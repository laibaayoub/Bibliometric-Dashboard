"In the continuously evolving educational landscape, the prediction of students' academic performance in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) disciplines stands as a paramount component for educational stakeholders aiming at enhancing learning methodologies and outcomes. This research paper delves into a sophisticated analysis, employing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict students' achievements, focusing explicitly on the multifaceted realm of STEM education. By harnessing a robust dataset drawn from diverse educational backgrounds, incorporating myriad factors such as historical academic data, socioeconomic demographics, and individual learning interactions, the study innovates by transcending traditional prediction parameters. The research meticulously evaluates several machine learning models, juxtaposing their efficacies through rigorous methodologies, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, subsequently advocating for an ensemble approach to bolster prediction accuracy. Critical insights reveal that customized learning pathways, preemptive identification of at-risk candidates, and the nuanced understanding of contributing influencers are significantly enhanced through the ML framework, offering a transformative lens for academic strategies. Furthermore, the paper confronts the ethical quandaries and challenges of data privacy emerging in the wake of advanced analytics in education, proposing a holistic guideline for stakeholders. This exploration not only underscores the potential of machine learning in revolutionizing predictive strategies in STEM education but also advocates for continuous model optimization, embracing a symbiotic integration between pedagogical methodologies and technological advancements, thereby redefining the trajectories of educational paradigms.","Abdrakhmanov, Rustam Zhaxanova, Ainur Karatayeva, Malika Niyazova, Gulzhan Zholaushievna Berkimbayev, Kamalbek Tuimebayev, Assyl",,"Abdrakhmanov, R Zhaxanova, A Karatayeva, M Niyazova, GZ Berkimbayev, K Tuimebayev, A",38,"[Abdrakhmanov, Rustam] Int Univ Tourism & Hospitality, Turkistan, Kazakhstan.

"Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) has been recognised by educators as an important educational objective in the 21st century. It provides a new vision of education by encouraging school teachers to engage students in problem-solving, critical-thinking and creative-thinking tasks using the knowledge and skills learned from multiple disciplines. While the effectiveness of STEM has been recognised by educators, the challenges of applying it to school settings have also been indicated, such as the difficulties in designing cross-disciplinary tasks and measuring students' learning performances. Mobile and ubiquitous technologies have been regarded as a potential facilitator which enables learners to learn across contexts with access to learning resources in anywhere and at any time. The use of these new technologies could provide new perspectives and opportunities for developing STEM activities and studies. This paper highlights the challenges as well as the strategies for implementing STEM activities in school settings and designing STEM research. It proposes several models for guiding researchers and schoolteachers to develop STEM learning design are proposed. In addition, it provides several strategies and measuring tools for developing in-depth experimental STEM studies.","Hwang, Gwo-Jen Li, Kam-Cheong Lai, Chiu-Lin",,"Hwang, GJ Li, KC Lai, CL",161,"[Hwang, Gwo-Jen] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Digital Learning & Educ, Taipei, Taiwan.

"The current article provides an overview of a Teacher Professional Development (TPD) program that has been designed, pilot tested, and implemented to investigate the impact of augmented reality (AR) on: (a) Teachers' level of technology (AR) acceptance, adoption of inquiry-based instructional approaches, and confidence towards teaching twentieth-first century skills in STEM-related courses; and (b) students' potential enhancement of specific twentieth-first century skills and motivation and interest during a STEM- (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)-related course supported with AR. This article focuses on the teachers' points of view concerning the impact of their STEM-related interventions on their students' motivation and learning, as well as the factors that influence the teachers' technology acceptance. The TPD program has been implemented in Cyprus and Greece with twenty-five lower secondary school teachers (20 in Cyprus and 5 in Greece). The research methodology applied is Educational Design Research (EDR), including an initial phase of the TPD program and a second (improved) phase. The data collection tools consisted of questionnaires, interviews, and observation of classroom interventions. Initial findings and their implications for teaching and future research are discussed, indicating the potential benefits and challenges surrounding the integration of AR within the educational process.","Lasica, Ilona-Elefteryja Meletiou-Mavrotheris, Maria Katzis, Konstantinos",121,"Lasica, IE Meletiou-Mavrotheris, M Katzis, K",,"[Lasica, Ilona-Elefteryja; Meletiou-Mavrotheris, Maria] European Univ Cyprus, Dept Educ Sci, CY-1516 Nicosia, Cyprus.

"Advocacy of STEM curricular approaches is based on a concern to engage students in authentic disciplinary and interdisciplinary practices in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) disciplines, and the need to promote participation in STEM pathways. The STEM Academy professional learning program was developed to support teachers to engage and motivate students by creating real-world, challenging problems. The initiative involved interdisciplinary teams of secondary STEM teachers attending workshops and working with university experts to design, implement and evaluate STEM curricular experiences. This paper focuses on case studies undertaken in two of the twelve schools involved in the initiative, using interview data from teachers and students, to explore the nature of their programs and their experiences. We investigate key features of these two schools' approaches, using a conceptual framework for integrated STEM, and explore the challenges and benefits of different features of integrated STEM that promote different dimensions of engagement in learning mathematics. We explore how the framework characteristics can be reframed into four dimensions that promote mathematics engagement in integrated STEM education - design thinking in authentic contexts, content integration, STEM practices and 21st Century skills, and exposure to professional practice.","Tytler, Russell Anderson, Judy Williams, Gaye",,"Tytler, R Anderson, J Williams, G",1299,"[Tytler, Russell] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia.

"The representation and success of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) have sparked discussions, given their underrepresentation in these traditionally male-dominated fields. While women comprise 40% of STEMM undergraduates, senior-level positions see this figure drop below 20%. Research suggests that gender disparities in STEMM participation result from motivational differences, rather than competence. Exploring the reasons for these disparities are important as they can have significant consequences for the acknowledgement of women in STEMM, the maintenance of their STEMM discipline, and future careers. As such, this study explored how the experiences of 13 female undergraduates in Australian STEMM programs impacted their motivation and persistence in their degree. Through face-to-face semi-structured interviews, analysed via reflexive thematic analysis, five themes were constructed, encapsulating diverse experiences shaping female undergraduates in STEMM, influencing self-efficacy, determination, and well-being. Early exposure and environment were pivotal, acting as motivators or deterrents. Additionally, peer support was suggested as being crucial, fostering belongingness in the male-dominated space. Participants also grappled with recognition challenges, influenced by gender imbalances and a lack of role models. Intimidation was evident, leading to thoughts of dropping out, but passion drove persistence amid these challenges. The research increases awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by female undergraduates in STEMM, offering valuable insights for developing strategies to enhance their university experiences and promote success in future STEMM careers.","Phillips, Matthew James",74,"Phillips, MJ",,"[Phillips, Matthew James] Curtin Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Populat Hlth, Discipline Psychol, Bentley 6102, Australia.",Curtin University,,,,,2025-01-19,female; STEMM; undergraduate; motivations; persistence; gender; academia,10.3390/socsci13020074,Article,,2076-0760,matthew.phillips@curtin.edu.au,,,,,IT1D9,BIAS; INTERVIEW; STUDENTS; VALUES,2,SOC SCI-BASEL,Soc.

"The United States is confronting important challenges at both the early and late stages of science education. At the level of K-12 education, a recent National Research Council report (Successful K-12 STEM Education) proposed a bold restructuring of how science is taught, moving away from memorizing facts and emphasizing hands-on, inquiry-based learning and a deeper understanding of the process of science. At higher levels of training, limited funding for science is leading PhDs to seek training and careers in areas other than research. Might science PhDs play a bigger role in the future of K-12 education, particularly at the high school level? We explore this question by discussing the roles that PhDs can play in high school education and the current and rather extensive barriers to PhDs entering the teaching profession and finally suggest ways to ease the entrance of qualified PhDs into high school education.","Doyle, Kari M.

"A diverse biomedical workforce is essential to achieve excellence in patient care, clinical translational, and basic research. Diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges in cancer molecular represent a combination of the challenges facing the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field, and challenges in Radiology and Nuclear Medicine. Although there is a growing awareness of conscious and unconscious bias that negatively affect the cancer imaging world, many challenges remain such as overcoming barriers to entry into the pipeline, avoiding program dropout, and providing long-term career prospect. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant setback and further highlighted problems faced by women and underrepresented minorities. In this perspective, we have identified some of the challenges faced and highlighted ongoing and future initiatives to address these challenges.","Daldrup-Link, Heike E.

"In recent years, we have seen an increasing focus in the academic environment on equity, diversity and inclusion. However, one broad group often left out of these discussions are disabled scientists/ scientists with disabilities, who often face severe challenges entering the research profession and navigating their careers. Building on the success of the 2022 Young Embryologist Network's meeting, which included a session on 'Working in science with a disability' (Morgan, 2023) we learn here from the lived experiences of five biologists who share the challenges and successes of undertaking a scientific career with a disability, as well as accommodations that can make science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM) careers more accessible and inclusive.","Anbuhl, Kelsey L.

"Technological advancements have created new methods for conducting research. In this article, we explore the benefits and challenges of using participant-produced video diaries as a research method in a remote environment. Participant-produced video diaries provide rich ethnographic data of lived experiences. Moreover, video diaries allow data collection without researchers needing to be physically present, which facilitates research in remote locations. Therefore, we chose video diaries as one method of data collection for our study of a leadership programme for women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine conducted in Antarctica. However, the remote location of this study raised methodological challenges beyond the routine issues associated with video diaries. In this article, we critically reflect on these challenges, highlighting implications for using participant-produced video diaries in other remote settings.","Nash, Meredith Moore, Robyn",,"Nash, M Moore, R",589,"[Nash, Meredith] Univ Tasmania, Sociol, Hobart, Tas, Australia.

"Latine students continue to persist in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields despite the numerous obstacles in place that stifle their academic potential and contributions. Instead of fostering the strengths Latine students possess that help them succeed despite these obstacles, the field of STEM education has traditionally examined these students' experiences and challenges through a deficit lens. Deficit perspectives posit that any existing disparities in educational outcomes in STEM for Latine students are a product of the students' lack of interest in STEM fields, poor academic preparation and/or motivation, among other 'faults.' In this manner, this deficit approach absolves educators, educational institutions, administrators, and researchers from any responsibility in mediating the disparate outcomes and negates the roles that outdated pedagogical practices, structural racism, discrimination and disciplinary bias have in limiting Latine students' success in STEM. These deficit-understandings of these inequities are pervasive in all aspects of STEM education, guiding curricular choices, pedagogical approaches, assessment designs, interventions and even how STEM fields define knowledge and success. To counter these harmful constructions, this article discusses how STEM educators can draw on Latino Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) and Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) epistemologies to foster learning ecologies that draw on Latine students' cultural strengths rather than deficits. To this end, this article introduces LatCrit and CCW frameworks in the context of STEM education, and combines them to propose an asset-based LatCrit pedagogical approach to STEM curriculum design and teaching. It also contributes guiding questions and application examples STEM educators can reference to advance asset-based LatCrit pedagogical approaches that promote justice and equity within STEM classrooms and beyond. Contributing to this underdeveloped line of scholarship in the field of STEM, we apply these critical frames to help educators (re)imagine postsecondary STEM pedagogies and reforms around the wealth of skills, dispositions, and cultural practices that Latine students possess.","Negrete, Ambar Hernandez Mouavangsou, Kaozong N.

"Social constructivism theory embraces peer-to-peer communication that helps students understand, examine, and discern the process of knowledge construction. The Social Constructivism Flipped-Classroom Model (SCFCM) inverts the traditional classroom paradigm by providing content outside of class, often through online materials, and devoting in-class time to active learning and discussion. This study aims to investigate the impact of the SCFCM on the conceptual understanding of photocatalysis, a crucial process in environmental science and chemistry, particularly in relation to sustainability and sustainable development. Photocatalysis, being a self-sustained process, holds potential for addressing global challenges such as renewable energy and pollution reduction, both of which are central to achieving sustainable development goals. A quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test design was employed at a public sector university, involving forty-three (43) students in each of the flipped- and non-flipped-classroom groups. Assessment tools, including pre- and post-tests and an interest survey, were used to gauge students' conceptual understanding of photocatalysis and their degree of learning interest. The same chemistry teacher, one who had eight years of teaching experience, taught both groups. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) results comparing students' performance showed a significant difference in the performance of students in the experimental group compared to the control group. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) results, however, revealed substantial differences in attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction between the experimental and control groups. The findings highlight that the SCFCM improved students' understanding of complex photocatalysis concepts and demonstrated its relevance to sustainable development, offering valuable insights into the potential of this teaching approach for Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) education, especially in addressing sustainability challenges.","Sarwar, Muhammad Naeem Maqbool, Muhammad Adnan Ullah, Shamim Rana, Amarah Sultan Khan, Salah Uddin Ibrahim, Ahmed Ahmed Alam, Kamran Zafar, Sehrish Ullah, Zaka Nazar, Muhammad Faizan",10324,"Sarwar, MN Maqbool, MA Ullah, S Rana, AS Khan, SU Ibrahim, AA Alam, K Zafar, S Ullah, Z Nazar, MF",,"[Sarwar, Muhammad Naeem] Univ Educ, Dept STEM Educ, Lahore 54770, Pakistan.

"Purpose: The barriers generally facing women wishing to pursue careers in the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) in the United States have been well described. However, additional layers of cultural beliefs and needs may pose further obstructions to women in certain cultural subgroups who wish to enter STEMM. Recognition of the challenges faced by such subgroups is important and culturally sensitive educational and training approaches may be necessary. Methods: We therefore created a science mentoring and education program incorporating the specific requirements of our test group, young Orthodox Jewish women. Our goals were to facilitate their knowledge, skills, and attitudes to embark on a scientific career in biomedicine. Interventions were designed to target physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual areas of growth with each intervention crafted to the sensitivity of the women's cultural and religious backgrounds. Results: Over the course of 6 years, we enrolled 59 Orthodox Jewish women, ages 16-20 years. These women spent their summers as part of the larger Summer Internship Program (SIP) at the National Institutes of Health. They participated in cohort sizes ranging from 6 to 26 in dozens of multilevel experiences in the SIP over 6-10 weeks. Participants reported strengthening interest to pursue careers in health care-related fields. Other graduates committed to pursue careers in the general sciences, and other graduate studies. Conclusion: This unique educational platform shows promise for other intersectional groups approaching educational barriers to careers in STEMM.","Goldfeiz, Sheindel Ifrah Knoll, Miriam Jagsi, Reshma Weinstock, Chana Pennebaker, James W.

"This study aimed to identify elements of personal knowledge that were hypothesized to underlie within-person, across-context variations in students' appraisals of self-efficacy for coping with challenges encountered in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Freshman in a college of engineering completed assessments of (a) 4 elements of personal knowledge regarding themselves and their educational resources; (b) their subjective beliefs about links between these 4 personal and social qualities and each of 32 specific educational challenges; and (c) perceived self-efficacy for successfully handling each of the 32 challenges. Individual students' self-efficacy appraisals commonly varied substantially within-person, across contexts. This variability was predictable. Students displayed relatively high ( low) self-efficacy within subsets of situations they subjectively linked to positively (negatively) valenced knowledge that they possessed, a finding consistent with the knowledge-and-appraisal model of personality architecture that guided the research. Additional analyses demonstrated that students with similar overall academic self-efficacy scores may display markedly different profiles of self-efficacy appraisal across context. Students' narrative accounts enriched understanding of these profile patterns. Educational Impact and Implications Statement This study introduces novel methods for assessing the beliefs of individual STEM students and the specific social contexts in which these beliefs come into play. Findings show that our assessments predict both consistency and variability in student's confidence in their ability to handle challenges encountered in STEM education. Because our assessment methods provide richer, more nuanced information about individual students than the assessments commonly found in the scientific literature, they may be of particular value to school counselors and advisors who need to understand idiosyncrasies in the beliefs and social experiences of the individual student.","Cervone, Daniel Mercurio, Lara Lilley, Carmen",,"Cervone, D Mercurio, L Lilley, C",1597,"[Cervone, Daniel; Mercurio, Lara] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, 1007 West Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.

"Disability remains an underacknowledged and underdiscussed topic in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM). Social stigma and fear of negative outcomes have resulted in a consistent lack of disclosure. Disabilities cause social and professional difficulties for those that have them. While some faculty can be allies, past literature shows that steps must be taken to make disabilities visible in STEMM at both student and faculty levels. Here, we offer suggestions to better support faculty and students in enhancing the outcomes of individuals who have invisible disabilities. Critically, techniques such as abolishing stigma, universal learning, and better mentoring may improve the challenges faced by those who self-identify as an individual with a disability.","Crabtree, Amber Neikirk, Kit Marshall, Andrea Barongan, Taylor Beasley, Heather K.

"Leadership development programs (LDPs) are one response to the under-representation of women in leadership positions. This article evaluates Homeward Bound, a 12-month LDP for women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine (STEMM) fields that culminates in a three-week voyage to Antarctica. We evaluate the extent that the program supports key features of LDPs for women - including creating a safe, women-only environment, providing professional networking opportunities and using intersectional approaches. We argue that remote locations generate challenges that must be considered in LDP design and implementation.

"In recent years, there have been growing calls to include STEM education in early childhood (EC). This has created new challenges for EC teachers as they try to find ways to integrate STEM content and pedagogical strategies into school-based curricula. This study interviewed 24 EC teachers to understand their roles in implementing STEM education in preschool classrooms. The qualitative interviews explored changes in teachers' roles and challenges before and after integrating STEM-related activities. The study revealed that the STEM education process is a dynamic one, and that the role of EC teachers is changing from one delivering teacher-centered knowledge to one fostering STEM-related learning in children. The research findings indicate that EC teachers face various challenges when implementing STEM education. The transformation of the teacher's role during STEM classroom practices when encountering a range of challenges is discussed.","Leung, Wai Man Vivienne",490,"Leung, WMV",,"[Leung, Wai Man Vivienne] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Early Childhood Educ ECE, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),,,,,2025-01-19,early childhood education; pedagogical strategy; STEM education; teachers' role,10.3390/educsci13050490,Article,,2227-7102,wmleung@eduhk.hk,,,"Central Reserve Allocation Committee, The Education University of Hong Kong [02361]","This study was funded by Central Reserve Allocation Committee, The Education University of Hong Kong [Project No.: 02361].",J4XK0,SCIENCE; ROBOTICS; BELIEFS; MODEL,5,EDUC SCI,Educ.

"We propose a conceptual framework for STEM education that is centered around justice for minoritized groups. Justice-centered STEM education engages all students in multiple STEM subjects, including data science and computer science, to explain and design solutions to societal challenges disproportionately impacting minoritized groups. We articulate the affordances of justice-centered STEM education for one minoritized student group that has been traditionally denied meaningful STEM learning: multilingual learners (MLs). Justice-centered STEM education with MLs leverages the assets they bring to STEM learning, including their transnational experiences and knowledge as well as their rich repertoire of meaning-making resources. In this position paper, we propose our conceptual framework to chart a new research agenda on justice-centered STEM education to address societal challenges with all students, especially MLs. Our conceptual framework incorporates four interrelated components by leveraging the convergence of multiple STEM disciplines to promote justice-centered STEM education with MLs: (a) societal challenges in science education, (b) justice-centered data science education, (c) justice-centered computer science education, and (d) justice-centered engineering education. The article illustrates our conceptual framework using the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has presented an unprecedented societal challenge but also an unprecedented opportunity to cultivate MLs' assets toward promoting justice in STEM education. Finally, we describe how our conceptual framework establishes the foundation for a new research agenda that addresses increasingly complex, prevalent, and intractable societal challenges disproportionately impacting minoritized groups. We also consider broader issues pertinent to our conceptual framework, including the social and emotional impacts of societal challenges; the growth of science denial and misinformation; and factors associated with politics, ideology, and religion. Justice-centered STEM education contributes to solving societal challenges that K-12 students currently face while preparing them to shape a more just society.","Lee, Okhee Grapin, Scott",,"Lee, O Grapin, S",,"[Lee, Okhee] NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA.

"In this position paper, we use the example of The University of Texas at Austin's Planet Texas 2050 (PT2050) to argue that the Grand Challenge (GC) framework for ambitious research initiatives must create meeting grounds for transdisciplinary integration of science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), arts, and humanities, along with community perspectives. We trace the historical trajectory of GCs, and reframe GC initiatives within the literature of inter- and transdisciplinarity. We present PT2050 as a case study of the infrastructural supports and imaginative process for creating level meeting grounds for transdisciplinarity. We demonstrate the benefits of these meeting grounds through projects, products, and funding generated. We contend that engaging arts, humanities, and community in co-design from the beginning is critical because complex, urgent challenges such as the climate crisis are embedded in human societies and demand solutions based in understanding of social, cultural, and historical contexts as well as STEM applications.","Lieberknecht, Katherine Houser, Heather Rabinowitz, Adam Pierce, Suzanne A.

"Inquiry-based learning as an instructional approach has been popular amongst STEM (i.e. science, technology, engineering, mathematics) disciplines, but the practice specifically in engineering education deserves further exploration. Employing a case-study approach, the present study was aimed to explore POGIL (Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) as an instructional strategy in an engineering course that included inquiry-based group activities. Using a questionnaire, students were then asked to report how they perceived their experience. The instructor's perception was garnered through an interview. Findings suggested that most students were in favour of the inquiry-based activities, but challenges in the implementation coexisted especially because it was conducted during the covid-19 pandemic. Pedagogical recommendations were provided to shed light on future implementation.","Luo, Tian Arcaute, Karina Muljana, Pauline Salim",,"Luo, T Arcaute, K Muljana, PS",836,"[Luo, Tian; Muljana, Pauline Salim] Old Dominion Univ, Dept STEM Educ & Profess Studies, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.

"This study examines the mediating role of school burnout and depression in the relationship between academic stress and sleep quality. The participant group of the study consists of 353 adolescents between the ages of 13-18 who are continuing their high school education (185 girls and 158 boys). The study data were collected using the Academic-Based Stress Inventory, Sleep Quality Scale, School Burnout Scale, and Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale. Correlation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to analyze the data. The results from testing the model have confirmed the tested mediation model. The study has found academic stress, depression, and school burnout to have direct effects on sleep quality, with academic stress also having an indirect effect on sleep quality through school burnout and depression within the scope of a model. The study also discusses the results in line with the obtained findings and makes suggestions for the literature.","Guendogan, Selim",,"Guendogan, S",95,"[Guendogan, Selim] Nigde Omer Halisdemir Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Educ Sci, Nigde, Turkiye.",Nigde Omer Halisdemir University,,,,,2025-01-19,Academic stress; Sleep quality; School burnout; Depression; Adolescence; Model test,10.15390/EB.2023.11497,Article,,,selimgundogan@ohu.edu.tr,111,,,,O5NJ4,PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MEDICAL-STUDENTS; ANXIETY; SYMPTOMS; CHILDREN; MINDFULNESS; ASSOCIATION; RESILIENCE; SCALE,215,EGIT BILIM,Egit.

"STEM education has been considered foundational to economic growth by many countries. It has received great attention from various educational systems, but the actual implementation has triggered several problems, especially in developing countries in Asia. This qualitative study investigated the challenges to STEM education in public high schools in Vietnam. The participants were ten experienced teachers from ten different schools in a Vietnamese central province. The data were collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the transcripts of the interview recordings showed that the teachers faced many challenges regarding their interdisciplinary knowledge and teaching methods, curriculum, practical constraints, and beliefs about effective STEM education. Notably, the findings concerning the teachers' beliefs about effective STEM education and the tension between their beliefs and the teaching goals were closely related to the local cultural values and the expectations of the schooling system.

"Economic growth has been attributed to STEM education in many countries. It is widely recognized as crucial to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, especially for traditionally disadvantaged groups. In this age of the fourth Industrial Revolution, we are going through a rapid change. Several difficulties have been associated with STEM's implementation, particularly troubling developing countries. In this article, we investigated STEM teachers' unique challenges in their classroom experiences and how these factors influence their instructional practices and students' learning outcomes. STEM teachers' teaching reflections at the secondary level were examined in this qualitative study. A purposive sampling method was used to recruit ten novice STEM teachers. The data were analyzed using NVivo11. Despite their disciplinary expertise and the variety of teaching methods they employed, the teachers faced numerous challenges. Teachers faced difficulties managing classrooms, developing curriculums, and recognizing practical constraints in STEM education. Teacher beliefs about effective STEM education, the tension between these beliefs and the teaching goals of the teachers were closely linked to the teachers' beliefs about effective STEM education and the educational system's expectations. For STEM teachers, the mastery of content knowledge is critical. A regular exchange of experience is of significant help to teaching. Teachers' pedagogy and professional development in STEM education are discussed concerning underdeveloped countries' contexts. Researchers and educators in developing countries might not understand STEM education's significance. The reason may also be that STEM education in developing countries faces several challenges.","Aslam, Sarfraz Alghamdi, Abdulelah A.

"Entrepreneurial STEM, an interdisciplinary approach blending STEM and entrepreneurship education, has become a new trend for cross-subject collaboration that aims to instill an entrepreneurial mindset in students, enabling them to apply their STEM knowledge across various contexts. In this study, we investigate the challenges and corresponding strategies of head science teachers who initiated an entrepreneurial STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) curriculum in their schools. Grounded in social exchange theory, we explore how head science teachers with entrepreneurial attributes navigated asymmetrical power distribution presented by principals and other subject heads. This collective case study focuses on three schools in Hong Kong that successfully implemented a renowned entrepreneurial STEM curriculum. The findings reveal a common trajectory among head science teachers: initial enthusiastic promotion of the curriculum while meeting resistance; a downscaling and team reform struggles; and a handover and scale-up. This study illuminates the intricate process of balancing power dynamics and stakeholder perceptions through reciprocal negotiation, which were in turn shaped by societal norms.","Ho, Chun Sing Maxwell",,"Ho, CSM",,"[Ho, Chun Sing Maxwell] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),,,,,2025-01-19,Entrepreneurial STEM curriculum; Entrepreneurial teachers; Science education; Social exchange theory; Interdisciplinary collaboration,10.1007/s11165-024-10172-7,Article; Early Access,MAY 2024,1573-1898,hocs@eduhk.hk,,,,,RU0Y8,LEADERSHIP,,RES SCI EDUC,Res.

"The Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework addresses the diverse learning needs of students with disabilities (SWDs) in post-secondary STEM education. The authors argue that supporting executive function skills (EFs) and learning strategies for students with disabilities (SWDs) during their learning process is important to the persistence and success of SWDs in post-secondary STEM education. Reviewed research indicates that EF challenges in post-secondary STEM education are a critical area for SWDs. Understanding current studies on the effectiveness of providing research-based practices (i.e., EF coaching and e-mentoring) for SWDs in post-secondary education can support the success of SWDs in post-secondary STEM education and diversify STEM workforce.

"This paper aims to explore the challenges that pre-service early childhood teachers (PECTs) face in the processes of planning and implementing STEM education-based activities and their solutions about these challenges. A total of 39 third-year pre-service teachers in Istanbul, Turkey, participated in the study, which lasted 14 weeks. The data were collected through an open-ended questionnaire and focus group interviews. The data were analyzed via qualitative approaches and codes and themes were determined. As a result of the analysis, five themes related to the planning of STEM education-based activities emerged: identifying the problem, group works conducted by the pre-service teachers, children's development level, material selection, and STEM integration. Regarding the challenges the PECTs faced during the implementation process of STEM education-based activities, six themes emerged: expressing the problem, group works conducted by the pre-service teachers, targeted instruction and implementations, children's development level, time management, and classroom management. The analysis revealed 8 themes regarding the pre-service teachers' solutions about successful planning and implementation of STEM education-based activities: materials to be used, group works conducted by the pre-service teachers, classroom arrangement and management, time management, appropriateness to children's level, identifying and expressing the problem, activity planning and implementation, and implementing STEM education. This study is important because it will contribute to the implementation of STEM-based activities more in early childhood classes, as it identifies the challenges faced in the process of designing and implementing STEM-based activities as well as providing suggestions for the solution of these problems.","Ciftci, Ayse Topcu, Mustafa Sami",,"Çiftçi, A Topçu, MS",422,"[Ciftci, Ayse] Mus Alparslan Univ, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Mus, Turkey.

"In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis on integrated STEM education, reflecting the fact that the four STEM disciplines (i.e., science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are often integrated in real-world applications. However, most K-12 teachers are trained within their own subject discipline and may not be capable of implementing an integrated approach to STEM education. There is therefore a need to develop teacher professional development (TPD) programs that can provide high-quality learning opportunities and support for teachers. The overarching goal of this research synthesis is to develop a set of design principles for effective TPD for integrated STEM education. To this end, this paper reviews 48 empirical studies and identifies the elements of effective TPD and potential challenges to implementing integrated STEM education. Content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and sample STEM instructional materials are the three most frequently reported elements of effective TPD programs. However, even with TPD, teachers encounter various obstacles to the implementation of integrated STEM education, including pedagogical challenges (e.g., teachers' limited STEM knowledge) and structural challenges (e.g., teachers' lack of preparation time and resources). Based on the findings of this review, a set of design principles (e.g., allocate TPD time for teachers' micro-teaching) is proposed. This review contributes to the design and implementation of TPD programs by leveraging studies of the effective elements of TPD and addressing the potential challenges to integrated STEM education.","Lo, Chung Kwan",,"Lo, CK",136,"[Lo, Chung Kwan] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Math & Informat Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; STEM integration; Professional development; Teacher education; Literature review,,Review,,1436-4522,chungkwanlo@eduhk.hk,152,,,,WJ7DW,MIDDLE SCHOOL SCIENCE; AUGMENTED REALITY; CONCEPTIONS; ELEMENTARY; IMPLEMENTATION; INSTRUCTION; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIES; ADVANTAGES; CLASSROOM,4,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

"Faced with the challenges of the 21st century, the line that separated the areas of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and the arts, is increasingly fluid. The inclusion of artistic thinking in the education of engineers and scientists points to an improvement in the ability to create products and services relevant to humanity. This model takes into account the humanization of labor relations, and a safe and responsible production process, which will promote a more balanced and fair relationship between society and the environment. This study focuses on a methodology that underlies this thought, which it is presented under the acronym STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics). It also aims to analyze the methodology, demonstrating how the subjectivity of the arts can act as an ally in innovation processes. In order to meet this study's purposes, a documentary and bibliographic research was carried out resulting in a seminar that illustrated the STEAM methodology.","Friggo e Barros, Cristiane Silva, Guido Vaz da Silveira Barros, Sergio Ricardo",,"Barros, CFE Silva, GV Barros, SRD",85,"[Silva, Guido Vaz] Univ Fed Fluminense UFF, Dept Engn, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol ICT, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.

"While achieving research independence by becoming a principal investigator (PI) is a key aspiration for many postdocs, little is known of the trajectory from PhD graduation to first PI grant. This interview-based study examined how 16 PIs in science, technology engineering, mathematics or medicine, in the UK and continental Europe, prepared for and dealt with this career transition. Individuals demonstrated commitment to lengthy periods of postdoctoral work in a range of institutions (often involving international mobility) to achieve PI-status. Their emotionally laden journeys required resilience and self-belief, since getting a grant was conceived as partly luck. Once individuals had their grant they faced new challenges that distanced them from actively researching. Still, individuals navigated their intentions in a sustained fashion to create a distinct intellectual profile in the face of challenging circumstances. The results highlight the centrality of emotion in the journey, as well as curricular imperatives for both doctoral and postdoctoral learning.","McAlpine, Lynn",,"McAlpine, L",49,"[McAlpine, Lynn] Univ Oxford, Oxford Learning Inst, Oxford, England.

"In the context of globalisation trends and the overall digitalisation of the education system, out -of -school education is becoming an important tool in the development of learning environments. The purpose of this paper is to describe the main innovative tools in out -of -school education, based on the analysis of key challenges and opportunities. The study is based on a qualitative analysis of pedagogical literature and individual legal documents. Content analysis of literature and comparative analysis became important methods in this study. The data collection was formed only on the basis of modern literature in the range of 2012-2024. The obtained results highlighted various innovative solutions used in extracurricular education and described the basis of the possibility of their effective implementation. Special attention is paid to the difficulties of their implementation. Given the challenges and opportunities for the successful implementation of innovations, the main mechanisms for the effective implementation of innovative technologies in out -of -school education institutions are developed. The conclusions note that the current challenges are the lack of material and technical resources for the active use of out -of -school education opportunities. In addition, the availability of appropriate professional training for teachers is also important. Thus, this study has demonstrated the importance of out -of -school education based on innovative technologies.","Bykovska, Olena Bykovskyi, Timur Bykovskyi, Yaroslav Klivadenko, Nataliia Shevchenko, Oleksandr",,"Bykovska, O Bykovskyi, T Bykovskyi, Y Klivadenko, N Shevchenko, O",129,"[Bykovska, Olena; Bykovskyi, Timur; Bykovskyi, Yaroslav; Klivadenko, Nataliia; Shevchenko, Oleksandr] Mykhailo Dragomanov State Univ Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine.",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Dragomanov Ukrainian State University,,,,,2025-01-19,difficulties; digitalisation; out-of-school education; edification innovative solutions; peculiarities implementation,10.46502/issn.1856-7576/2024.18.02.9,Article,,,,140,,,,XQ3Q9,,2,EDUWEB-REV TECNOL IN,Eduweb-Rev.

"The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence-supported tool, to overcome the challenges in the implementation of early childhood STEM education based on teachers' views. In the study, a case study, which is a qualitative research method, was used. The participants of the study consisted of 43 early childhood teachers specialized in the field of STEM education who were determined by purposeful sampling method. Within the scope of the study, a training program was developed for teachers to integrate ChatGPT into early childhood STEM education and teachers voluntarily participated in this program. During the training process, the researchers collected data through observation reports and semi-structured interviews conducted after the training. The collected data were subjected to content analysis using MAXQDA software, and themes, categories and codes were identified. The findings revealed the teachers' views that the use of ChatGPT in early childhood STEM education would be beneficial. It was determined that ChatGPT would provide advantages such as guidance, effective use of existing materials, the opportunity to design student-specific activities, and the potential to complete teachers' missing knowledge. However, teachers also think that ChatGPT may cause negative situations such as technological addiction, regression in social skills, damage to the teacher-student relationship and misinformation. In conclusion, ChatGPT can benefit students' education.","Ugras, Hilal Ugras, Mustafa",,"Ugras, H Ugras, M",,"[Ugras, Hilal] Firat Univ, Karakocan Vocat Sch, Dept Child Dev, Elazig, Turkiye.

"The value of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and the significance of conducting research motivated the conduct of this study. As teachers take on a more active role in knowledge generation, studying their research attitudes, motivations, and challenges has become more relevant and timely. This paper aimed to describe Filipino STEM education researchers based on the three aforementioned parameters. To achieve this goal, a total of 46 STEM teacher-researchers were purposively sampled to answer an online survey. Three of the responses, however, were excluded due to incomplete answers. Results revealed that the respondents held a positive outlook towards research and consider it as an avenue for professional growth. They also recognized the positive impacts of research on their teaching skills and in their students. learning experiences. Both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations were reported to be the main stimuli in doing research. Time and financial constraints, heavy workload, and lack of exposure and experience in research were some of the challenges identified by the respondents.

"Purpose This study provides an overview of the ""double reduction"" policy promulgated in 2021, through which the Chinese government attempts to relieve the burden of excessive school homework and off-campus tutoring for students in compulsory education.Design/Approach/Methods This study draws on policy documents and relevant literature to interpret policy origins, core values, and major measures. The positive effects and challenges faced in implementing policies for the balanced and high-quality development of compulsory education were analyzed.Findings Students' academic burden is deeply rooted in Chinese historical and sociocultural contexts. The ""double reduction"" policy shows the Chinese government's strong aspiration to promote holistic education for students and pursue the universal provision of balanced, high-quality school education. Despite some positive effects at the implementation level, challenges remain unaddressed. To achieve a policy vision, it calls for a deep reflection on the high-stakes examination system and collective efforts from stakeholders within or outside the education system.Originality/value This study helps elucidate the ""double reduction"" policy and compulsory education development in China.","Chen, Licui Lin, Shuangmu",,"Chen, LC Lin, SM",,"[Chen, Licui; Lin, Shuangmu] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.",Zhejiang University,,,,,2025-01-19,"China; compulsory education; ""double reduction"" policy; education policy",10.1177/20965311241265123,Review; Early Access,JUL 2024,2632-1742,licuichen@hotmail.com,,,National Office for Education Sciences Planning of China [CHA220290],"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Office for Education Sciences Planning of China (grant number CHA220290).",ZQ6N1,ACADEMIC STRESS; ANXIETY,,ECNU REV EDUC,ECNU Rev.

"Background: Given the growing interest in, and relevance of, integrated approaches to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education, there is an urgent desire to understand the challenges and obstacles to developing and implementing integrated STEM curricula and instruction. In this article, we present phase 1 of a two-phase needs assessment study to identify challenges and needs of promoting integrated approaches in STEM education. Utilizing a key informant approach, 22 K-12 teachers and four administrators selected as potential leaders in STEM education in an unidentified state on the East Coast of the USA were interviewed. Participants were asked to identify challenges and perceived supports to conduct integrated STEM education. Questions were open-ended in order to inform a larger, state-wide questionnaire study in phase 2 to be reported subsequently and were qualitatively coded. Results: Several distinctive themes were identified as described by teacher participants when discussing challenges and obstacles of implementing integrated STEM education, as well as supports that would be most helpful in overcoming them. Participants also provided specific suggestions for teacher education needed to support integrated STEM education. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that many teachers are interested in integrated approaches to STEM, but do not believe they are well prepared to implement them. Teachers and administrators also suggest that adequate preparation in integrated STEM would entail a considerable rethinking and redesigning of pre-service courses and in-service workshops. Findings provide a starting point for better understanding teacher needs in integrated STEM and a springboard for further study.","Shernoff, David J. Sinha, Suparna Bressler, Denise M.

"Integrated STEM education within North America has become a popular pedagogy; however, teachers identify challenges that arise when planning for and implementing integrated STEM education. These challenges may threaten STEM teachers' capacity to balance disciplinary and integrated learning, a core feature of effective STEM education. The purpose of this study was to investigate how exemplary STEM teachers navigate tensions of practice to balance disciplinary and integrated learning. Through an in-depth qualitative methodology, drawing on interview and artifact data from 14 purposefully selected exemplary secondary and elementary integrated STEM teachers, this study identified tensions that teachers faced as they navigated planning for and implementing integrated STEM education: (a) curriculum content versus skills; (b) guided instruction versus inquiry and play; (c) process versus task completion; and (d) collaboration versus individual needs. In line with a Worldly Perspective (Rennie et al., 2020), balancing these tensions leads to enhanced integration.","Dubek, Michelle Rickey, Nathan Deluca, Christopher",,"Dubek, M Rickey, N Deluca, C",249,"[Dubek, Michelle] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ OISE, Toronto, ON, Canada.

"Nowadays Cloud computing technology is considered pivotal for the success of any business or organisation. This technology is not just an infrastructure that is used to implement various strategies rather it makes new emerging strategies possible. However, to embrace this emerging technology, the challenges and uncertainties about the expected economic, technical and operational feasibility, and related security, privacy and regulatory concerns, successful transition from planning to design and implementation, as well as its overall impact on the individual organisation, needs to be estimated or identified. Notwithstanding, such studies have been undertaken across different sectors other than the Indian school education system to tailor out unique cloud computing solutions as per the business needs of the individual organisations. Therefore, given the unique requirements of the Indian school education system, this research undertakes feasibility analysis, identifies various challenges and barriers related to the adoption and transition towards the cloud, and offers efficient cloud computing adoption strategy with services and solution offerings together with enhanced security framework.","Singh, Jewan Mansotra, Vibhakar Mir, Shabir Ahmad Parveen, Shahzada",,"Singh, J Mansotra, V Mir, SA Parveen, S",2375,"[Singh, Jewan; Mir, Shabir Ahmad] AMET Univ, Dept IT, ECR Kanathur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

"Digital media and connected technologies have brought some new ethical challenges to the surface. Digital media ethics is the scientific and systematic study of ethical attitudes and problems in relation to the use of digital media. This paper discusses the role of digital media ethics in modern school education. First, it is argued that digital media ethics is best perceived as a dimension of digital competence more generally. Since the development of students' digital competence is one of the central ambitions in modern school education, there is good reason to teach digital media ethics in school. Then, the authors go on to argue that there are at least three potential benefits from teaching digital media ethics: (i) students will increase their digital competence; (ii) students will develop their ability to use digital and connected technologies such as mobile phones for learning; and (iii) students will be helped in living a good life. Finally, the authors offer some reflections on challenges that might arise when digital media ethics is integrated in school education.","Ott, Torbjorn Tiozzo, Marco",304459,"Ott, T Tiozzo, M",,"[Ott, Torbjorn] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Educ & Special Educ, Gothenburg, Sweden.

"STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education is vital for incubating future scientists, engineers, and inventors. Teaching and learning in STEM education require teachers and students to employ design thinking and multi-disciplinary knowledge to formulate new solutions for emerging problems. School teachers are facing multiple challenges in implementing STEM education. With the application of the Self-efficacy and stages of concern theories, this quantitative study (with 235 teacher respondents) aims to unearth Hong Kong teachers' responses regarding STEM education. The results show that 5.53% of the respondents regard themselves as well prepared for STEM education. On the other hand, the respondents have intense information, management, and consequence concerns about implementing STEM education in schools. The findings reflect that there is an urgent need to provide teachers with articulated professional development, pedagogic support, and curricular resources for empowering them to implement STEM education in practice.","Geng, Jie Jong, Morris Siu-Yung Chai, Ching Sing",,"Geng, J Jong, MSY Chai, CS",35,"[Geng, Jie; Jong, Morris Siu-Yung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CLST, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

"Emotional intelligence (EI) correlates highly with Academic Stress (AS). Given the significance of EI in education and the lack of research on Muslim students in Indonesia, this study explored the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and academic stress (AS) among STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students in Islamic universities. Wong's Emotional Intelligence Scale (WEIS) and Educational Stress Scale for Adolescents (ESSA) questionnaires were used to evaluate emotional intelligence and educational stress levels. Demographic characteristics such as gender and year of study were also considered. In this cross-sectional survey, 400 students were invited, and 363 completed it, resulting in a response rate of 90.8%. Of all the participants, 204 (56.2%) were female. According to the findings, female students had higher AS levels than male students, and fourth-year students had the lowest AS. The study also revealed a negative correlation between EI and AS, particularly in the male sample. The study suggested that EI and gender can be reliable predictors of lower AS. Therefore, including EI in the STEM education curriculum is recommended to reduce AS among Muslim students.","Iskandar, Iskandar Abu Bakar, Abu Yazid Defrianti, Denny Setiawan, M.

"Integrated STEM education is a novel and at times controversial approach to teaching, particularly in school systems such as China where there strong are traditions of teacher-directed learning. Implementation of integrated STEM education is influenced by teachers' experiences of established and new teaching practices that shape what teachers may identify as challenges and opportunities. Our aim in this study is to address the need for understanding teacher experiences with integrated STEM education in primary and middle school contexts in Beijing, China. We adopt a methodology informed by grounded theory to explore and interpret the ideas generated by 12 teachers of integrated STEM. Our findings indicate both resonance and difference with international experiences in terms of challenges that are experienced, and the complexities of issues related to teaching practices. The interplay between integrated STEM and mathematics education is an important feature of this study, which opens a broader issue about teacher and student understandings of engagement. The study also addresses teacher professional development and professional learning to support the implementation of integrated STEM education in Chinese schools. This study highlights issues with: engaging Chinese students in integrated STEM lessons; resonance and difference between Chinese and international teachers; and, contextualized professional development. Future research should address the diversity of education in China, and access to student voice in relation to integrated STEM education.","Lyu, Qianru Chiang, Feng-Kuang Davis, James",,"Lyu, Q Chiang, FK Davis, J",491,"[Lyu, Qianru] Nanyang Technol Univ Singapore, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.

"With the rapid development of the global economy and science and technology, STEM education has become an important strategy and approach for the cultivation of scientific and technological innovation talents and the reform of education and teaching in various countries worldwide. This study provides an overview of previous STEM education research studies carried out in Pakistan to clarify the current condition in STEM education in Pakistan. A qualitative research method was used to conduct this study, and 13 previous studies were selected (2008-2020) as the sample. Results indicate that STEM education practices by private sectors are visible more than the public sector. Moreover, it was found that there is a lack of laboratories, equipment, and other resources needed to teach STEM education. In essence, Pakistan's STEM education system is not adequately prepared and centered. There is an exclusive involvement needed by the government to support the efforts of all stakeholders, including the public and private. This study provides some suggestions for future research. Researchers need to design such a function that allows stakeholders to acquire necessary competencies relevant to STEM disciplines.

"This study presents a systematic review of the existing literature on the benefits and challenges faced regarding the use of augmented reality (AR) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method, a systematic review of the ScienceDirect database identified 19 related studies. Further investigation of these articles resulted in four themes of AR advantages, namely its contribution to learners, the learning outcomes, the interaction of AR, and other benefits. These four themes further produced a total of 16 sub-themes, while the challenges aspect of AR resulted in 5 sub-themes. The most reported benefit of AR is that it stimulates learning achievement. Some observed that the challenges imposed by AR are concerned with marker detection and usability. Several other problems and advantages of AR usage in STEM education were also discovered, which will be discussed in detail. Additionally, the existing gaps of AR study in the STEM education field were identified, and recommendations are therefore presented for future research.","Ajit, Gloria Lucas, Terry Kanyan, Ringah",,"Ajit, G Lucas, T Kanyan, R",,"[Ajit, Gloria; Lucas, Terry; Kanyan, Ringah] UNIV MALAYSIA SARAWAK, Fac Appl & Creat Arts, Sarawak, Malaysia.",University of Malaysia Sarawak,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM; Augmented reality; systematic review; education,10.25115/eea.v38i3%20(2).4280,Review,,1697-5731,gloriaajitfrancis@gmail.com; lerry@unimas.my; kringah@unimas.my,,,Malaysia Ministry of Education under HLP Programme,The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Malaysia Ministry of Education under HLP Programme.,QY4ZH,SCIENCE LABORATORIES; GAMES; TECHNOLOGY; MOTIVATION; KNOWLEDGE; PATTERNS; TRENDS; AR,1,ESTUD ECON APL,Estud.

"Standardized assessment of content knowledge for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) topics is pervasive in both K-12 and postsecondary institutions. Yet, most instruments are developed with little to no validation for students with learning disability (LD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of new test instruments designed to assess conceptual understanding of statistics content and the extent to which construct-irrelevant factors, such as language processing, influence the performance of students with disabilities. Generalized linear mixed-effects modeling was used to identify the factors that were predictive of student performance. Results indicate that the average sentence length in word problems was uniquely predictive of student performance on emerging assessments of conceptual understanding. The results provide new evidence of the barriers facing students with disabilities on emerging tests of conceptual knowledge. A general framework for measuring the impact of these barriers and the effectiveness of accommodations is discussed.","Dahlstrom-Hakki, Ibrahim H.

"The changing and challenging conditions of the 21st century have been significantly impacting our economy, society and built and natural environments. Today generation of knowledge, mostly in the form of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and arts, is seen as a panacea for the adaptation to changes and management of challenges. Making space and place that concentrate on knowledge generation, exchange, and marketing has become a priority for many nations. Consequently, the concept of knowledge city is coined at the beginning of the century and since then it is widely researched and practiced. This paper aims to scrutinise and provide a clear understanding on the evolution of knowledge city research and practice. As the methodological approach, the study employs systematic review of the knowledge city empirical studies in peer-reviewed journals. The findings shed light on the emerging patterns, identify research and practice gaps, and point out research directions to advance the field.","Edvardsson, Ingi Runar Yigitcanlar, Tan Pancholi, Surabhi",,"Edvardsson, IR Yigitcanlar, T Pancholi, S",537,"[Edvardsson, Ingi Runar] Univ Iceland, Sch Business, Reykjavik, Iceland.

"There has been a significant paucity of representation of women in the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) on a worldwide scale. Women are more likely to be at a disadvantage than men due to the existence of gender prejudices as well as other social and cultural variables. This tendency is also present in India. Feminist scholars within the Science, Technology, and Society field have conducted thorough examinations of the gender component, despite their relatively small representation. This study aims to examine the challenges faced by female scientists in higher education institutions in India to comprehend these issues. It employs a phenomenological approach, using primary data to investigate how female scientists perceive their day-to-day lives and the world around them, and it focuses on the perceptions and experiences of these women. The study finds that women who work in STEMM fields face a wide variety of challenges and roadblocks both on the personal and professional front. In addition, it highlights certain attitudes that have a negative impact on women working in the field of science, such as the rationalization of institutional prejudices and unwillingness to recognize discrimination. It concludes with a few policy implications.","Jaiswal, Astha Namrata, Hemant Kumar, Hemant",,"Jaiswal, A Namrata Kumar, H",446,"[Jaiswal, Astha] Manipal Univ, Ctr Distance & Online Educ, Jaipur, India.

"The purpose of this study is to provide other developing countries in the region a reference on the successful design education reformation in Taiwan. The study first reviews Taiwan's economic and design development to show their interconnection with local culture and the global market. Next, the study explores Taiwan's design education development which transforms from adopting STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) to STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics) in secondary school, and understands how it overcomes challenges by the help of both public and private sectors. Last, a conceptual framework is proposed to present and study Taiwan's design education development. The result from case studies validates that STEAM can reach SAD (science, arts, and design) in higher education and CHEER (collaboration, humanity, empathy, ecology, and renaissance) in design practice. Therefore, the result and implications provided by this study can serve as a reference for other countries in the region who share similar cultural and socioeconomic development and future goals as Taiwan.","Lin, Chinlon Huang, Jianping Lin, Rungtai",171,"Lin, CL Huang, JP Lin, RT",,"[Lin, Chinlon; Huang, Jianping; Lin, Rungtai] Natl Taiwan Univ Arts, Grad Sch Creat Ind Design, New Taipei 22058, Taiwan.",National Taiwan University of Arts,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM; STEAM; design education; gender equality; interdisciplinary,10.3390/educsci11040171,Article,,2227-7102,10735903@mail.ntua.edu.tw; 10735905@mail.ntua.edu.tw; rtlin@mail.ntua.edu.tw,,,,,RR3FM,SCIENCE,4,EDUC SCI,Educ.

"This commentary documents how federal funding agencies are changing the criteria by which they distribute taxpayer money intended for scientific research. Increasingly, STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine) funding agencies are requiring applicants for funding to include a plan to advance DEI (""Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion"") in their proposals and to dedicate a part of the research budget to its implementation. These mandates undermine the academic freedom of researchers and the unbiased generation of knowledge needed for a well-functioning democracy. Maintaining excellence in science is fundamental to the continuation of the U.S. as a global economic leader. Science provides a basis for solving important global challenges such as security, energy, climate, and health. Diverting funding from science into activities unrelated to the production of knowledge undermines science's ability to serve humankind. When funding agencies politicize science by using their power to further a particular ideological agenda, they contribute to public mistrust in science. Hijacking science funding to promote DEI is thus a threat to our society.","Efimov, Igor R. Flier, Jeffrey S. George, Robert P. Krylov, Anna I. Maroja, Luana S.

"Although the number of Hispanic/Latina women earning medical degrees has increased in recent years, the article by Anaya and colleagues in this issue highlights their stark underrepresentation in the U.S. physician workforce. In this Invited Commentary, the authors provide context on proposed drivers of underrepresentation, including bias, discrimination, harassment, and other structural barriers, which are amplified for women with multiple minoritized identities. They summarize the 2020 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommendations for supporting women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields, including committed leadership, dedicated financial and human resources, data-driven accountability, and use of an intersectional approach to address the challenges faced by individuals who encounter multiple forms of bias and discrimination. The authors also provide additional recommendations and highlight innovative new National Institutes of Health funding opportunities to promote diversity in the scientific workforce. They argue that more research is needed to identify and best implement institutional practices that increase representation and retention of Latina women and other women with minoritized identities in STEMM fields.","Rodriguez, Carolyn, I Jagsi, Reshma Mangurian, Christina",,"Rodriguez, CI Jagsi, R Mangurian, C",331,"[Rodriguez, Carolyn, I] Stanford Sch Med, Off Acad Affairs, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

"Background China has great student participation in STEM education. Chinese society has a progressive and positive attitude towards STEM as it is considered to provide more opportunities in life. Teachers play a vital role in the success of any STEM program in K-12 schools. However, teachers are facing instructional challenges because of the interdisciplinary nature of the STEM curriculum and the current typical school structure. The success of the STEM programs depends on teachers' beliefs and their knowledge in adapting to instructional implementation of STEM concepts. Results The data (n= 216) was collected from STEM primary and secondary teachers from 25 provinces in mainland China. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied, and Pearson's correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation between Chinese STEM teachers' beliefs, knowledge, implementation, and the intrinsic challenges of STEM education;ttests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to ascertain whether there were differences. The structural equation model (SEM) was applied to identify interrelationships. The results indicated that Chinese STEM teachers encounter higher-level intrinsic challenges to instructional implementations based on their beliefs and knowledge. Teachers who utilize their experience of teaching science as their main discipline and then attempt to integrate STEM using mathematics and engineering are likely to encounter higher-level intrinsic challenges in implementation. Conclusion The intrinsic challenges perceived by Chinese teachers in the practice of STEM education can be predicted by their beliefs and knowledge base. Teachers who understand the nature and pedagogy of STEM education are more likely to encounter lower-level intrinsic challenges of STEM teaching, while teachers who utilize their main discipline when conducting integrated STEM learning activities through modeling based on science, technology, engineering, and mathematical problem situations are more likely to encounter higher-level intrinsic challenges. This study also reveals that there are some significant differences in the level of STEM teachers' beliefs, knowledge base, instructional practice, and their intrinsic challenges based on their teaching grade, seniority, and experience of STEM training and teaching.","Dong, Yan Wang, Jing Yang, Yunying Kurup, Premnadh M.",47,"Dong, Y Wang, J Yang, YY Kurup, PM",,"[Dong, Yan; Wang, Jing] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"STEM education has drawn considerable international attention in recent decades. Current practices of STEM Education in China have shown that STEM is understood primarily as a policy-driven and economic problem. This paper challenges the reduced technical frameworks of STEM education and draws on the theoretical framework of the reconceptualization movement in the curriculum field. It aims to shift scientific or social science paradigms with languages of humanity to reapproach STEM education. STEM education is hence reconceptualized as praxis in its lived, ethical and historical dimensions. It would transform STEM education in China from being targeted for economic growth to attending to lived, nuanced and rich STEM experiences, structured by ethics and threaded by history. STEM teachers and teacher educators are advised to understand anew about STEM in their situatedness. STEM could serve as an opportunity to critically reflect on and research each discipline in greater depth with inter-disciplinary lenses. Instead of integrating science, technology, engineering and mathematics seamlessly to form omnipotent toolsets for the 21st-century workforce in China and on the international landscape, a reconceptualization of STEM as praxis could continue to generate more sustainable STEM education.","Ma, Ying",4961,"Ma, Y",,"[Ma, Ying] Univ British Columbia, Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum Studies, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",University of British Columbia,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education in China; praxis; curriculum reconceptualization,10.3390/su13094961,Article,,2071-1050,anita.maying@gmail.com,,,,,SC8AH,,9,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,English,,51,gold,"Ma, Ying/0000-0001-7464-2768","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",MAY,14,BASEL,,,J,MDPI,2021,,"Ma, Y (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum Studies, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,SUSTAINABILITY,,,8,Reconceptualizing STEM Education in China as <i>Praxis</i>: A Curriculum Turn,26,96,WOS:000650886100001,13,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),8
"This paper investigated the integration of a Lesson Study Model (LSM) into distance STEM education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study focused on six dimensions: (1) STEM education in distance learning, (2) Lesson Study (LS), (3) lesson planning processes, (4) challenges of lesson planning, (5) evaluation and assessment methods, and (6) strategies, methods, and techniques. The sample consisted of 24 science teachers recruited using criterion sampling, which is a purposive sampling method. A case study, which is a qualitative research method, was the design of choice. Data were collected through interviews, videotapes, and expert observations. The data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Themes, categories, and codes were developed in accordance with the research purpose. Participants had positive opinions about the LSM, STEM education, and distance learning. Participants stated that the LSM activities within distance learning contributed to pedagogy and content knowledge in the STEM education process. The challenges faced by participants were unfavorable environmental conditions, time management issues, and a lack of knowledge and experience in lesson planning. Expert observations and videotapes corroborate these results, indicating that the LSM integrated with STEM education results in higher quality STEM lesson planning and teaching. Moreover, distance learning platforms are promising ways to ensure the professional development of teachers during the pandemic.","Aykan, Ahmet Yildirim, Bekir",,"Aykan, A Yildirim, B",609,"[Aykan, Ahmet] Mus Alparslan Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Educ Sci, TR-49250 Mus, Turkey.

"I Dream with and through a positionality that lacks critical theorizing in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education research: Students labeled with disabilities; Disability beyond students' accommodations. Understanding this marginalized population can push humanistic STEM scholarship to disrupt ableism by design, thereby honoring students' voices, identities, and Dreams as knowledge-building sources. Engaging purposefully along such a proactive centering of these margins pushes STEM researchers to think beyond past challenges and break away from the free-market value commoditizations of education. I urge we Dream future possibilities of humanistic STEM education where researchers, teachers, and students are aligned to build new cultures of joy and feelings of relational belonging. In this way I seek to nurture the brilliance of students who are historically marginalized, including Disabled people, because of a desire to define their studenthood on their own terms. I argue that STEM education researchers working toward ""what if"" leveraging intersectionality as a way to critically theorize design can do more than change disciplinary practices: We can help students to Dream beyond ""what is.""","Boda, Phillip A.",,"Boda, PA",1590,"[Boda, Phillip A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Special Educ, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,,,,,2025-01-19,critical disability studies; epistemic injustice; humanistic lenses; STEM education,10.1002/sce.21891,Article,JUN 2024,1098-237X,paboda@uic.edu,1607,,,,J9G2T,PERSPECTIVES; STUDENTS; EXPLORATION; CHALLENGES; SMARTNESS; JUSTICE; SCIENCE; COLOR,6,SCI EDUC,Sci.

"The focus on integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education that prepares students for an ever-changing society is gaining momentum. Recent STEM education research has concentrated on developing guiding principles for integrating STEM amid the lack of a unified definition and varied implementations of STEM integration. Aware of the challenges posed by the inconsistent language and lack of consensus on a common definition, we recognise the importance of educators developing a shared conceptual framework and co-constructing a vision for STEM education. This research reports on the STEM education perspectives held by key stakeholders in Irish primary STEM education. Using qualitative surveys and interviews, we investigate primary teachers' and teacher educators' conceptions of STEM education alongside their perceptions of approaches to and the efficacy of integrated STEM education. Insights are provided into how engagement in STEM education professional development programmes supports the development of understandings and practices. The research contributes valuable insights into the unique perspectives of primary education practitioners regarding balancing the affordances of integrated STEM alongside the perceived threat to content knowledge development within the discrete STEM disciplines.","Hourigan, M.

"This article begins with a historical overview of the STEM education policy and related classroom practices in Hong Kong. Against the backdrop that the Hong Kong education authority has been promoting STEM education over the past few years, there has been a pressing need for effective strategies of implementing STEM education in the context of reduced class size classrooms (i.e. small class teaching). With a view to addressing this need, this article strives to exemplify the incorporation of STEM education into small class teaching settings. Intended as a conceptual paper drawing on design approaches for STEM lessons and a small class teaching framework, the article demonstrates the relevance of STEM education to small class teaching. Two illustrative lesson design examples are provided to showcase how the design approaches and framework can be operationalised. In addition, the article also offers a thoughtful discussion concerning the potential challenges of delivering the two sample lessons as well as the coping strategies. It contributes to understanding of STEM education theories and provides a valuable reference for educational practitioners.","Liang, Weijun Fung, Dennis",,"Liang, WJ Fung, D",189,"[Liang, Weijun; Fung, Dennis] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",University of Hong Kong,,,,,2025-01-19,Design approaches; Hong Kong experience; Small class teaching; STEM education,10.1007/s40299-022-00643-8,Article,JAN 2022,2243-7908,weijun15@connect.hku.hk,209,,,,9L2UZ,EFFECTIVE GROUP WORK; CRITICAL THINKING; SELF-EFFICACY; TEACHERS; SCIENCE; MATHEMATICS; KNOWLEDGE,2,ASIA-PAC EDUC RES,Asia-Pac.

"Women make up a small percentage of the scientific community, including conservation. Today, conservation efforts are vital for the survival of many species, however there is a gender bias within the conservation field. Encouraging more women into conservation could be a key to increasing efficiency and success in conservation goals of organizations and governments. Here we investigate the long running Earthwatch, working guest and intern volunteer programs of the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) to understand women's involvement with volunteer based conservation, and questionnaire data to understand women's contribution to conservation after volunteering and what challenges women face in conservation. Our results showed there was significantly more female volunteers than male volunteers (p-value <0.000) and on average, females contributed to 73.7% of the volunteer population annually. Volunteer's age at time of volunteering varied between the three volunteer programs. Women's motivations for volunteering and challenges that women face in conservation was dependent on the volunteers' age. CCF's holistic approach to conservation, volunteers' love for cheetahs and ability to gain practical skills were the leading motivations why women volunteered with CCF. Many (87%) of the female interns said volunteering was a means of helping them gain employment. Women's credibility, family responsibility and personal safety were the main challenges that women face working in conservation today. Addressing gender disparities in every stage of career progression will lead to overall improved conservation outcomes.","Marker, Laurie Pfeiffer, Lauren Maketo, Tracy Poentinen, Annetjie",1028851,"Marker, L Pfeiffer, L Maketo, T Poentinen, A",,"[Marker, Laurie; Pfeiffer, Lauren; Maketo, Tracy; Poentinen, Annetjie] Cheetah Conservat Fund, Otjiwarongo, Namibia.",,,,,,2025-01-19,female; conservation; cheetah; STEM; science technology engineering mathematics; volunteer; intern,10.3389/fcosc.2022.1028851,Article,,2673-611X,director@cheetah.org,,,,,I5KU0,HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT; SCIENCE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; TOURISM,,FRONT CONSERV SCI,Front.

"This article investigates STEM education perceptions among pre-service teachers from various specialties at a pedagogical university in Ukraine, highlighting its role in addressing socio-economic and environmental challenges of the country. The study aims to understand how pre-service teachers from various specialties view the integration of STEM into their professional activity. Key findings indicate that while there is a general positive attitude towards STEM education, significant variations exist across different specialties. Pre-service teachers of the 'Science' and 'Early Childhood and Primary Education' categories demonstrate higher engagement with STEM-oriented tasks compared to those in the 'Arts and Humanities' and 'Social Sciences' categories. The research reveals a gap in pre-service teachers' understanding of STEM's interdisciplinary nature, often associating it primarily with technological innovations. The study identifies several barriers to the effective implementation of STEM education, including limited resources, insufficient knowledge of teachers, and a lack of appropriate teaching materials. To address these challenges, the article suggests enhancing STEM courses, providing professional development for teachers, and fostering collaboration with industry. Overall, the research underscores the importance of aligning STEM education with the needs and perceptions of pre-service teachers, emphasising its role in developing critical skills for future educators and contributing to Ukraine's recovery.","Petryk, Kristina Nesterenko, Maryna Mytsyk, Hanna Kovachov, Serhii Kryvylova, Olena Suchikova, Yana",,"Petryk, K Nesterenko, M Mytsyk, H Kovachov, S Kryvylova, O Suchikova, Y",,"[Petryk, Kristina; Nesterenko, Maryna] Berdyansk State Pedag Univ, Dept Primary Educ, UA-69063 Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.

"In today's interconnected world, implementing media and information literacy (MIL) into school education is essential to equip students with the critical skills needed to navigate an increasingly complex information landscape and discern between credible sources and misinformation. By fostering a generation of media -literate individuals, students can be empowered to become responsible consumers, creators, and contributors in the digital age, thus safeguarding democratic principles and promoting informed civic engagement. This research paper delves into the critical challenges surrounding the implementation of MIL in school education across Central Asian countries, with a specific focus on Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Through a comprehensive examination, the study addresses key issues such as the perceptions of MIL trainers and experts regarding its significance, exemplary approaches for integration into school education, assessment methods of MIL education programs, differences between Central Asian and global MIL programs, the impact of MIL deficiency on the educational system, and the potential consequences of neglecting its implementation. Drawing on in-depth interviews, existing literature, and comparative analyses, the paper sheds light on the complexities and implications of MIL implementation within the unique context of Central Asia.","Dadakhonov, Azamjon Oltmishevich",,"Dadakhonov, AO",,"[Dadakhonov, Azamjon Oltmishevich] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Fac Social Sci Media & Sport, Dept Journalism, Saarstr 21, D-55122 Mainz, Germany.",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,,,,,2025-01-19,Central Asia; Consequences; Educational Impact; Challenges; Integration; Media and Information Literacy (MIL); School Education,10.34135/mlar-24-01-03,Article,,2585-9188,mr.dadakhonov@gmail.com,,,"Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) [1/0203/20]","Acknowledgement: The study was created as a part of the national project supported by Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) No. 1/0203/20:""Development and standardization of screening methods on identification of occurrence and risk of problematic legal drug use among adolescents"".",YC6E2,,1,MEDIA LIT ACAD RES,Media Lit.

"Multigrade teaching is challenged to ensure opportunities for access to authentic and relevant learning experiences, such as those available to students in traditional schooling contexts. In this reflection article, we argue that one way to address this and other challenges of teaching in multigrade contexts is to implement STEM education by supporting and encouraging teachers to design integrated STEM curricular units. We begin this article by sharing some considerations about the main challenges of multigrade education and the potential of integrated STEM education to address them. Next, we analyze the purpose of various teaching strategies in multigrade contexts reported in the literature, and we expose the main challenges associated with the design of integrated STEM units, identifying key aspects that must be considered to develop this type of proposals in such contexts. Finally, based on the identified aspects, we offer an alternative to bring STEM education closer to the multigrade classroom by proposing a framework to guide the design of integrated STEM units in these contexts.","Castro-Inostroza, Angela Jimenez-Villarroel, Rodrigo Medina-Paredes, Jhonny",,"Castro-Inostroza, A Jiménez-Villarroel, R Medina-Paredes, J",339,"[Castro-Inostroza, Angela; Jimenez-Villarroel, Rodrigo; Medina-Paredes, Jhonny] Univ Austral Chile, Puerto Montt, Chile.",Universidad Austral de Chile,,,,,2025-01-19,educational strategies; integrated curriculum; interdisciplinary approach; multigrade education; primary education,10.14483/23448350.17900,Article,,2344-8350,agela.castro@uach.cl; rodrigo.jimenez@uach.cl; jhonnymedina@uach.cl,352,,,,WC8EK,PRIMARY-EDUCATION,3,REV CIENT-COLOMBIA,Rev.

"STEM education has been emphasized in the UAE education reform because science, technology, mathematics and engineering are considered as the main disciplines that reflect the development of a country's economic situation. Although STEM education benefits all students, its professions do not stimulate them all. Students have the right to pursue any other career that satisfy their ambition. For more effective STEM implementation in its early stage in the UAE, there is a need for a practical E-STEM model to guide STEM educators to integrate entrepreneurial practices into their existing STEM courses to enhance students' entrepreneurial act. An exploratory sequential design was conducted through mixed-method approach to collect qualitative data from 12 STEM leaders regarding how entrepreneurial practices could be incorporated into STEM education. Moreover, quantitative data was collected from 134 Science, Technology, Mathematics and Business teachers regarding the challenges that might eliminate this incorporation in the UAE. Results revealed that experiential learning through competency-based practices is the best approach to adopt interdisciplinary E-STEM model with high school students. However, some E-STEM challenges were highlighted to be examined in the future research such as lack of STEM teachers' knowledge about entrepreneurial learning. Further studies are recommended to investigate the impact of the developed interdisciplinary E-STEM model on enhancing students' entrepreneurial competencies.","Eltanahy, Marwa Forawi, Sufian Mansour, Nasser",100697,"Eltanahy, M Forawi, S Mansour, N",,"[Eltanahy, Marwa; Forawi, Sufian] British Univ Dubai, Dubai Int Acad City DIAC, 1st & 2nd Floor,Block 11,POB 345015, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.

"In this study, the authors address the case of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) content teachers in an English medium instruction (EMI) environment in Kazakhstan to argue that the professional needs and identities of these teachers are considerably different than the specialist English teachers who teach English language skills and grammar. Therefore, STEM teachers require a different language policy response and diagnosis, and should be understood through a different analytical lens. The study draws on qualitative interviews with one EMI expert and 58 STEM content teachers from six cities or regions of Kazakhstan to present an account of the challenges they confront within mainstream schools. Findings suggest that policies force STEM content teachers to take the role of English teachers, although they are not prepared for that role. These teachers emphasize that their main responsibility is to teach course content, not the English language. As a result, they undergo several dilemmas such as professional [dis]investment and identity crisis, linguistic disadvantages, inferiority complexes, and pedagogical and theoretical limitations. Top-down policies render local teachers and practitioners voiceless and disconnected from policymaking. The authors propose a non-traditional, participatory, and non-hierarchical policy framework, where policy actors at different levels collaboratively engage to assess teachers' diverse needs and take contextually informed actions to address the afore-stated dilemmas and challenges.","Manan, Syed Abdul Hajar, Anas",,"Manan, SA Hajar, A",,"[Manan, Syed Abdul; Hajar, Anas] Nazarbayev Univ, Astana, Kazakhstan.",Nazarbayev University,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1002/tesj.847,Article,JUL 2024,1949-3533,samanan1998@gmail.com,,,Nazarbayev University,Nazarbayev University,N3F8A,LANGUAGE; EDUCATION,4,TESOL J,TESOL J.,English,,63,hybrid,"Hajar, Anas/0000-0001-7513-9689; Abdul Manan, Syed/0000-0002-8703-5876","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",DEC,24,HOBOKEN,,,J,WILEY,2024,"Hajar, Anas/AAI-9143-2020; Manan, Syed/AAC-4186-2020","Manan, SA (corresponding author), Nazarbayev Univ, Astana, Kazakhstan.",Education & Educational Research,,1056-7941,TESOL JOURNAL,,,3,Understanding English medium instruction (EMI) policy from the perspectives of STEM content teachers in Kazakhstan,4,4,WOS:001272825800001,15,,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),3
"Although many other factors come to bear on present issues in the contemporary world, vaccine hesitancy and refusal are also the direct result of poor STEM education. In this article we employ a sociological thought experiment methodology to articulate the shortcomings of STEM education and suggest pathways for much needed changes in solving future pandemics and other 21st century challenges. The problems we expose in STEM education include unequal access to high quality education via inter and intra school tracking and curricular issues where STEM does not integrate with other disciplines, like social studies, and fails to engage a critical perspective on STEM informed by advanced philosophies of science and epistemology.","Wolfmeyer, Mark Lupinacci, John",,"Wolfmeyer, M Lupinacci, J",108,"[Wolfmeyer, Mark] Kutztown Univ Penn, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA.

"BackgroundFor schools to include quality STEM education, it is important to understand teachers' beliefs and perceptions related to STEM talent development. Teachers, as important persons within a student's talent development, hold prior views and experiences that will influence their STEM instruction. This study attempts to understand what is known about teachers' perceptions of STEM education by examining existing literature.ResultsStudy inclusion criteria consisted of empirical articles, which aligned with research questions, published in a scholarly journal between 2000 and 2016 in English. Participants included in primary studies were preK-12 teachers. After quality assessment, 25 articles were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis was used to find themes within the data. Findings indicate that while teachers value STEM education, they reported barriers such as pedagogical challenges, curriculum challenges, structural challenges, concerns about students, concerns about assessments, and lack of teacher support. Teachers felt supports that would improve their effort to implement STEM education included collaboration with peers, quality curriculum, district support, prior experiences, and effective professional development.ConclusionsRecommendations for practice include quality in-service instruction over STEM pedagogy best practices and district support of collaboration time with peer teachers. Recommendations for future research are given.","Margot, Kelly C.

"This perspective paper analyses the possibilities and challenges of using cheminformatics as a context for STEM education. The objective is to produce theoretical insights through a SWOT analysis of an authentic educational cheminformatics project where future chemistry teachers engineered a physical 3D model using cheminformatics software and a 3D printer. In this article, engineering is considered as the connective STEM component binding technology (cheminformatics software and databases), science (molecular visualizations), and mathematics (graph theory) together in a pedagogically meaningful whole. The main conclusion of the analysis is that cheminformatics offers great possibilities for STEM education. It is a solution-centered research field that produces concrete artifacts such as visualizations, software, and databases. This is well-suited to STEM education, enabling an engineering-based approach that ensures students' active and creative roles. The main challenge is a high content knowledge demand, derived from the multidisciplinary nature of cheminformatics. This challenge can be solved via training and collaborative learning environment design. Although the work with educational cheminformatics is still in its infancy, it seems a highly promising context for supporting chemistry learning via STEM education.","Pernaa, Johannes",,"Pernaa, J",1190,"[Pernaa, Johannes] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Unit Chem Teacher Educ, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",University of Helsinki,,,,,2025-01-19,High School/Introductory Chemistry; Chemoinformatics; Interdisciplinary/Multidisciplinary; Analogies/Transfer; Computational Chemistry,10.1021/acs.jchemed.1c00683,Article,,1938-1328,johannes.pernaa@helsinki.fi,1200,,,,1N0LY,CHEMISTRY; SOFTWARE; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; EXPERIENCES; GENERATION; SIMILARITY; KNOWLEDGE; MODELS; KIT,3,J CHEM EDUC,J.

"Despite ongoing efforts to increase the number of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and in medicine, Hispanic women remain severely underrepresented in these fields. This disparity not only hinders scientific innovation and the delivery of culturally competent medical care but also perpetuates a systemic exclusion. Research specifically addressing the challenges faced by Hispanic women, the extent of underrepresentation in these disciplines, and strategies to mitigate these issues is sparce. The authors conducted a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed articles to address this gap. The findings reveal a stark underrepresentation of Hispanic women across all examined fields, particularly compared with White women. In addition, the underrepresentation persists when compared with Hispanic men, although the disparity is less pronounced. The authors identify ongoing disparities in promotion, compensation, and retention rates for Hispanic women; present data for barriers to entry and retention; and highlight existing programs and strategies aimed at addressing this underrepresentation. Finally, a framework is presented for future studies and actionable initiatives, and the broader implications of these findings for the field of oncology are highlighted.","Gencel-Augusto, Jovanka Minaya, Natasha J.

"The past decade has seen growing awareness of the challenges faced by LGBTQIA+ scientists, including discrimination in the workplace and the lack of representation. Initiatives such as 500 Queer Scientists, Pride in STEM and the Microbiology Society's LGBTQIA+ events have been instrumental in promoting inclusivity in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM). The Microbiology Society and its members have played a pivotal role in these efforts and summarized here are their initiatives towards safer and more inclusive scientific and research environments. Starting with a series of interviews and blog posts about the experiences of LGBTQIA+ microbiologists in research, the Society has promoted the organization of networking and social events and developed guidelines for creating more inclusive scientific conferences. These initiatives have not only improved the representation and visibility of LGBTQIA+ individuals in microbiology, but have also served as a blueprint for similar efforts in other scientific areas. Nevertheless, despite improvements in some areas, full inclusion of LGBTQIA+ scientists is still hindered by societal and institutional policies around the world. Here, we propose novel measures to support and empower LGBTQIA+ microbiological communities within learned societies.","de Oliveira, Bruno Francesco Rodrigues Donovan-Banfield, I'ah Penrice-Randal, Rebekah Casey, Rowan Goncalves-Carneiro, Daniel",001468,"de Oliveira, BFR Donovan-Banfield, I Penrice-Randal, R Casey, R Gonçalves-Carneiro, D",,"[de Oliveira, Bruno Francesco Rodrigues] Fluminense Fed Univ, Biomed Inst, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.

"Digital literacy promotes students' competitiveness and better opportunity in today's digital world and in the fourth industrial revolution (FIRe). This descriptive-survey research determined the digital literacy of science, technology, engineering & mathematics (STEM) senior high school students. A total of 130 respondents from two state-owned public high schools in Zambales, Philippines answered the digital literacy survey questionnaire. Results revealed that a typical STEM respondent came from school B, aged between 15-17, female and currently Grade 11. The STEM students are digitally literate to some extent in terms of access and evaluation of information; utilization and management of information; media analysis; creation of media products; effective application of technology; and interaction through technology. There is a significant difference in the extent of digital literacy of students when grouped according to sex and grade level. Moderate significant relationship exists across all domains digital literacy. The study recommends the implementation of the proposed digital literacy working group to enhance students' digital proficiency and to equip them with the challenges of the FIRe.

"There remains a clear deficiency in recruiting middle school students in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine fields, especially for those students entering physiology from underrepresented backgrounds. A large part of this may be arising from a disconnect between how science is typically practiced at a collegiate and K-12 level. Here, we have envisioned mitochondria and their diverse subcellular structures as an involver for middle school students. We present the framework for a workshop that familiarizes students with mitochondria, employing three-dimensional visual-spatial learning and real-time critical thinking and hypothesis forming. This workshop had the goal of familiarizing middle school students with the unique challenges the field currently faces and better understanding the actuality of being a scientist through critical analysis including hypothesis forming. Findings show that middle school students responded positively to the program and felt as though they had a better understanding of mitochondria. Future implications for hands-on programs to involve underrepresented students in science are discussed, as well as potential considerations to adapt it for high school and undergraduate students.","Marshall, Andrea G.

"Women of Color faculty continue to experience many challenges in their careers, especially in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. As such, more research is needed that considers structural issues inhibiting their success. Using structuration theory and critical race feminism as a conceptual framework, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 faculty and administrators in STEM departments at higher education institutions to investigate their perceptions of structural impediments impacting early-career Women of Color STEM faculty careers. Our findings revealed the need to establish policies that are clear, documented, and transparent. Additionally, incremental approaches to tenure and promotion evaluations should be reconsidered, especially when this approach may position Women of Color faculty to appear as if they are underperforming, when the opposite may be true. Furthermore, as higher education institutions endeavor to diversify the professoriate, this study is significant in enabling institutions and STEM departments to be aware of systemic issues confronting them to make significant inroads in retaining and advancing Women of Color faculty in these disciplines.","Woods Jr, Johnny C.

"Translational behavioral medicine involves experts from different disciplines and professions interacting to solve complex problems. Coordinating this expertise can be frustrated by the partially tacit nature of expertise and by the various ways in which it manifests in different communities. We describe a method-the Toolbox dialogue method-for addressing these challenges by means of a structured dialogue among team members concerning their respective approaches to complex problems. The Toolbox dialogue method consists of a philosophically grounded questionnairethe "" Toolbox""-deployed in workshops by collaborators from different disciplines and professions. The Health Science Toolbox was modified from an extensively utilized questionnaire designed for Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) research and has been piloted with translational medicine teams. Eighty-five percent of participants in STEM workshops indicated a positive impact on awareness of the knowledge, opinions, or scientific approach of teammates. In the Health Science Toolbox, 35% of questionnaire responses changed substantially from pre-to post-workshop, demonstrating impact of the workshops. The Toolbox dialogue method is a relatively brief workshop encounter that can have a positive impact on mutual understanding within translational medicine teams.","Schnapp, Lynn M.

"This article is a bibliographic approach that main understand the historical processes that allowed to the Indians, the access to school education and training for the Indian educator. The objective was to analyze differentiated school education, teacher training and curriculum. Differentiated school education in Brazil has been a theme that researchers from different areas of knowledge have been working on, in order to understand it, looking for a pedagogical model that meets the specificities of indigenous groups. With this, the training of indigenous teachers is guided as a possibility to manage a school education that meets the interests of the original people, as well as a curricular proposal aimed at pedagogical, cultural and political interests, in order to vitalize and revitalize the indigenous identity. The debates around the theoretical references consulted as Ghedin (2007), Grupioni (2000), Perez Ruiz (2011), Urquiza (2017), and others, made it possible to know the main challenges of the reality of indigenous school education. In this sense, it is the intention to do a reflection on the effectiveness of intercultural education, and as it is necessary to continue training, consolidation and strengthening the identity of the traditional people for the construction of the specific and intercultural curriculum.","Monteiro, Alcioni da Silva do Nascimento Mascarenhas, Suely Aparecida",e17338,"Monteiro, AD Mascarenhas, SAD",,"[Monteiro, Alcioni da Silva] Univ Fed Amazonas UFAM, Ensino Ciencias & Humanidades, Labrea, Amazonas, Brazil.

"This article develops four school education scenarios to help educators consider the role of digital technologies in future teaching and to provoke discussion of how education might be done differently. The context for these scenarios is a world shaped by the COVID19 pandemic. The development of education scenarios is a useful device for thinking about the future and is often used as a methodology to stimulate discussion about possible variations in education. We use our empirical data from a recent study of Australian schools illustrating exemplary remote-teaching, to generate four alternative scenarios for future school education, with a particular focus on learning agency, and the level of educational technology use. We show how different contexts and different student needs are supported by each of the four scenarios. This set of scenarios challenges the common perception that remote learning is only effective through high end use of online technologies, and suggests there is a role for both student-led and teacher-led approaches, depending on the particular contexts. The article discusses the place of innovation in disadvantaged and technology-restricted contexts. It concludes with an analysis of the ways in which school education might respond to future challenges and opportunities.","Kearney, M. Schuck, S.

"Systemic equity challenges in K-12 STEM education place students from minoritized groups on an uneven footing, restricting access and opportunity for the diverse students who make up the majority population in US public schools. Teachers play a key role in advocating for equity and justice in STEM education. In positioning themselves as agents of change, they have the power to impact their classrooms, schools, and communities. Using a collaborative coding process informed by dominant and critical framings of equity in STEM education, we analyzed equity research presentations and final written reflections from a graduate course for practicing teachers (n = 23) focused on STEM integration. Teacher participants demonstrated one of four advocacy orientations: (a) equity in classroom teaching, (b) STEM education, (c) equity in STEM education, or (d) neither equity nor STEM. Our analysis of teachers' final course reflections led us to develop a rubric using principles of grammar to evaluate the levels of agency evident in teachers' statements. Most teachers were at least minimally agentic for STEM, but fewer teachers were agentic for equity. Only four of 23 teachers were highly agentic for equity in STEM education. We identify a need for more purposeful scaffolding in professional learning to build teacher advocacy and agency for equity in STEM education. Future research should explore the high-leverage practices in STEM teacher education that foster advocacy and agency.","Holincheck, Nancy M. Galanti, Terrie M.

"In the current scientific moment, as stated by Caro et al. (2020), despite the large amount of disciplinary research being carried out, different forms of supradisciplinary research are also emerging, such as multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. Today's societies go forward very quickly, and education systems do not always evolve at the same rate, which leads to the relevant difficulties in the implementation of new curricula that try to respond to the demands of societies related to these advances. Education must prepare citizens to face future challenges and provide an efficient response to the resolution of complex problems that may arise. Therefore, this article presents a literature review to address STEM education as a transdisciplinary practice in secondary and high school in the classroom. For this purpose, different databases have been used during the years 2015-2023, specifically WOS (Web of Science) and SCOPUS. This review aims to answer the question of whether the STEM experiences carried out in the classroom have really been designed from a transdisciplinary approach.","Perez, Cristina Chavarria Guede-Cid, Rocio",,"Pérez, CC Guede-Cid, R",61,"[Perez, Cristina Chavarria; Guede-Cid, Rocio] Univ Rey Juan Carlos URJC, Madrid, Spain.",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM; transdisciplinarity; secondary education; high school education,10.35362/rie9215804,Article,,1681-5653,,70,,,,N3NH2,STUDENTS,1,REV IBEROAM EDUC,Rev.

"Early STEM education (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) has a significant role in developing thinking in children in preschool and elementary school age. The process of learning supports children's development in constructing their own knowledge, in designing, discussing, and testing ideas and finding solutions to different problems. The questions and solutions that require non-standard thinking and imagination provoked John Maeda in 2002 to introduce the arts to the commented approach. At the beginning, he proposed to integrate only the visual arts and especially those in the field of design, but many educators defended the thesis that, in addition to those listed, others could be added too. Thereby, creativity, cultural diversity and aesthetic features as form and content are added to the scientific fields and the approach acquires the extended version- STEAM. The results of the research and analysis of music educators' positions showed the need to implement music to STEM subjects and the need to train teachers to learn how to integrate music into the STEAM approach.","Karaminkova-Kabakova, Emiliya",,"Karaminkova-Kabakova, E",1137,"[Karaminkova-Kabakova, Emiliya] Sofia Univ, Fac Educ Studies & Arts, Dept Mus & Multimedia Technol, Sofia, Bulgaria.",University of Sofia,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM; STEAM; music; preschool and primary school education,10.53656/ped2024-8.07,Article,,1314-8540,karaminkov@uni-sofia.bg,1155,,"European Union-NextGenerationEU, through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan of the Republic of Bulgaria [SUMMIT BG-RRP-2.004-0008-C01]","This study is financed by the European Union-NextGenerationEU, through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan of the Republic of Bulgaria, project SUMMIT BG-RRP-2.004-0008-C01.",L6D1O,,8,PEDAGOGIKA,Pedagogika,Bulgarian,,16,,,"BUL TSARIGRADSKO SHOSE, 125, BL 5, SOFIA, 1113, BULGARIA",,19,SOFIA,,,J,NATSIONALNO IZDATELSTVO AZ BUKI,2024,"Karaminkova-Kabakova, Emiliya/AAM-1654-2021","Karaminkova-Kabakova, E (corresponding author), Sofia Univ, Fac Educ Studies & Arts, Dept Mus & Multimedia Technol, Sofia, Bulgaria.",Education & Educational Research,,0861-3982,PEDAGOGIKA-PEDAGOGY,,,0,ATTITUDES AND CHALLENGES MUSIC TEACHERS IN PRESCHOOL AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FACE WHEN INTEGRATING MUSIC IN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY STEAM APPROACH,6,6,WOS:001351593800007,96,,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),0
"This study examines the critical aspects of remote STEM education in the post-pandemic period, from the perspectives of students and faculty at four European universities. This research was conducted approximately four years after the COVID-19 pandemic began, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness and challenges of remote learning alongside advancements in educational technology and teaching models. Data were collected via structured questionnaires from over five hundred students and almost two hundred faculty members from four European universities. The study focused on resource availability, technical responsiveness, training adequacy, online assessment feedback, and social dynamics. Results reveal notable discrepancies between student and faculty perceptions regarding both assessment feedback and the significance of student-faculty interactions. While students viewed timely and detailed feedback as essential to their learning, faculty placed less emphasis on it, prioritizing instead the importance of direct interactions with students, a factor that students themselves considered less critical. Despite these differences, both groups acknowledged the broader challenges to educational quality and academic integrity. The study also found a general consensus among the universities involved, with no significant gender bias. These findings provide valuable insights for educational policymakers and institutions, helping refine remote teaching strategies and assessment methods to improve the quality and effectiveness of remote STEM education.","Maisano, Domenico A.

"This study aims to evaluate the integration of AI-supported ChatGPT into early childhood STEM education from the teachers' perspective. The study group comprised 18 teachers who had previously received training on the use of ChatGPT. A phenomenological approach was adopted within the qualitative research framework, utilising a semi-structured interview form and researcher diaries as data collection tools. The collected data were analysed using content analysis with the aid of MAXQDA software, and the findings were interpreted based on predefined categories and codes. The study's findings indicate that teachers generally agree that integrating ChatGPT into early childhood STEM education would be beneficial. Teachers highlighted the significant role of ChatGPT in providing instant feedback, including personalised content suggestions, encouraging creativity, enhancing real-life relevance, and boosting student motivation. Additionally, ChatGPT's features accelerated the educational process, offering teachers greater flexibility in planning and promoting equality among students. However, challenges in integrating ChatGPT were also identified, including technical issues, student-related difficulties, and a need for more security knowledge. To address these challenges, teachers should receive both technical and pedagogical support. In conclusion, while integrating ChatGPT into early childhood STEM education presents numerous advantages, it also requires careful management. Recommendations include providing pedagogical support for teachers, offering information literacy training for students, and implementing strategies to ensure a smooth integration process.","Ugras, Hilal Ugras, Mustafa Papadakis, Stamatios Kalogiannakis, Michail",,"Ugras, H Ugras, M Papadakis, S Kalogiannakis, M",,"[Ugras, Hilal] Firat Univ, Karakocan Vocat Sch, Dept Child Dev, Elazig, Turkiye.

"In line with the substantial interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and the major projects in STEM curriculum development around the world, efforts should be particularly made to increase the supply of STEM teachers through proper and effective teacher professional development. Although there have been a number of studies related to teacher professional development for individual subject training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, quality research on professional development for teachers to develop their capacity for adopting the integrative and cross-disciplinary approaches advocated in STEM education remains in its infancy. The theme of this special issue is two-fold: (a) to provide researchers and practitioners in STEM education with a scholarly platform for reflecting on what challenges and impediments STEM teachers have encountered, and (b) to exchange new theoretical and practical insights gained from empirical research on designing, enacting and evaluating professional development programmes for building teachers' capacity in STEM education.","Jong, Morris Siu-Yung Song, Yanjie Soloway, Elliot Norris, Cathleen",,"Jong, MSY Song, YJ Soloway, E Norris, C",81,"[Jong, Morris Siu-Yung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

"Digital technology is increasingly used in STEM education for young children aged 0-8 years. An extensive literature search was conducted using seven databases to systematically investigate the effect of digital technology on young children's STEM education. Twenty-two eligible articles published from 2010 to 2021 were identified. Results showed that robotics, programming, and multimedia were used to support young children's STEM education. Digital technology plays different roles in the process of STEM education. Outcomes also showed that digital technology positively affected young children's STEM education in terms of STEM knowledge or skill acquisition and learning engagement. This was regardless of gender but relevant to age and the learning condition. Participating children and teachers reported high acceptance and satisfaction with the included programs. However, many difficulties, challenges and criticisms were revealed by the extracted data, including how digital technology is used in young children's STEM education, the nature of young children, the requirements placed upon educators, and different types of adult-child interactions.

"The modern integration of digital technologies into the educational process requires additional study, given the opportunities that this process opens up. The purpose of the article is to study the use of digital technologies in STEM educ ation through the prism of researching the main challenges and prospects. To achieve this goal, the methods of questionnaires and interviews were used. In particular, 65 teachers of higher education institutions were interviewed, whose opinions became the basis for forming a generalised picture of the study. The results show that modern teachers actively use digital technologies in STEM education. The average level of digital technology use among STEM teachers is high: 43 people (65%) use technology at grade levels 4 and 5. However, this intensive use of digital technologies in STEM education raises both challenges and opportunities. In particular, today's teachers often face limited access to the necessary technical infrastructure, which can limit their ability to implement digital tools. Poor quality of internet connection can affect the smoothness and efficiency of using online resources. Insufficient training of teachers in the use of digital technologies is also a significant challenge. Incre asing the availability of digital resources for teachers will make learning more accessible and diverse. Cooperation between universities and technology companies also opens up new opportunities for the development of STEM education. The conclusions emphasise that such interaction facilitates the exchange of experience, access to advanced technologies and resources, and creates conditions for the implementation of joint projects and programmes.","Hubal, Halyna Siasiev, Andrii Sipii, Volodymyr Syrmamiikh, Iryna Burtovyi, Serhii",,"Hubal, H Siasiev, A Sipii, V Syrmamiikh, I Burtovyi, S",445,"[Hubal, Halyna] Lutsk Natl Tech Univ, Fac Transport & Mech Engn, Dept Higher Math, Lutsk, Ukraine.

"In this study, we provide an overview of the STEM education in Israel, the formal and the informal, the strengths and challenges, the problems, and the national plans to solve them. STEM education in Israel is an interesting phenomenon, as the State of Israel is considered a start-up nation, even though students have scored mediocre on the PISA tests over the years compared to the OECD average. The paper is based on literature review of position papers written for decision makers in the Israeli education system and for the purpose of comparison with other advanced education systems in the world.","Goldreich, Aharon Karashtranova, Elena",,"Goldreich, A Karashtranova, E",671,"[Goldreich, Aharon] Minist Educ, Tel Aviv, Israel.

"The current study brings a debate about the teaching of the English Language (EL) in the Quilombola School Education (QSE), in 3 quilombola schools in the Salvaterra city in the Marajoara Amazon. The research analyzed the teaching of EL and its developments in the QSE, allowing to highlight other perspectives for the teaching of the language. Methodologically, the research used Bakhtin's Conception of Language (2003, 2010, 2011) and Applied Linguistics (AL) as an analytical framework. The research results showed that valuing the identity issues of Quilombola students in the QSE's EL classes is still a challenging field in the QSE's proposal.","Ribeiro, Karley dos Reis dos Santos, Raquel Amorim Abdon, Gisele Reis",,"Ribeiro, KD dos Santos, RA Abdon, GR",89,"[Ribeiro, Karley dos Reis] Univ Fed Para UFPA, Linguagens & Saberes Amazonia PPLSA, Belem, Para, Brazil.

"The traditional lecture-based model of teaching and learning has led to the exploration of innovative approaches including digital escape rooms. Digital escape rooms offer an immersive and engaging experience that promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork, making them a unique opportunity to address the challenges of STEM education, which is often perceived as difficult, boring, and intimidating. In this study, the goal is to explore the application of digital escape rooms as an innovative practice in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education in Europe. More specifically, the study aims to evaluate the influence of digital escape rooms on student engagement and learning outcomes in mathematics education as well as to provide valuable insights into the efficacy of this approach as a means of teaching mathematics and fostering active and experiential learning in STEAM education. In order to investigate the potential of digital escape rooms as a metaphor for breaking down barriers and escaping from the ""box"" in STEM education, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding the pedagogical value of digital escape rooms in STEM education. It outlines the design process, including learning paths and scenarios, storyline, puzzles, challenges, and feedback mechanisms, and presents a concept of escape room design patterns. An example case study of a digital escape room designed to teach mathematics to university students is also presented, providing insights into the effectiveness of this approach. By using digital escape rooms as a metaphor for breaking down barriers in STEM education, a more inclusive, engaging, and impactful learning environment can be created to prepare students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.","Sidekerskiene, Tatjana Damasevicius, Robertas",7393,"Sidekerskiene, T Damasevicius, R",,"[Sidekerskiene, Tatjana] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Appl Math, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania.

"This study focuses on assessing the growth of the latest developments of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as part of an effort to maintain the progress of STEM education. Assessment is necessary for every educational activity, including in the field of STEM education. However, there are limited comprehensive reports on the progress and development of STEM education inside individual Asian countries. An attempt to bring up the sustainable development of STEM education is conducted by using an exhaustive assessment. The assessment, within this study, includes three domains, namely attitudes, knowledge, and applications (AKA) regarding STEM education. The comparison of these three domains based on demographic data, teachers' difficulties perception, and its contribution to the sustainable development of STEM education is, likewise, discussed. This type of research is a mix of both qualitative and quantitative research methodology. The quantitative analysis method was performed to address the level position and the comparative value of the three domains. In comparison, the qualitative analysis method was employed to strengthen the quantitative result analysis, as well as to deal with the teachers' perception. Results show that science teachers have a very good attitude, a moderate-level category in the application, and a low-level category in knowledge regarding STEM education. Further, there are differences in knowledge and the application of STEM education, based on educational background and teaching experience of the teachers, yet there are no differences regarding teachers' attitudes. Other components are discussed in detail, such as the teacher's perception of STEM teaching difficulties. Providing challenges and opportunities for improving the quality of education in the future are discoursed. The results of this study suggest that knowledge and attitudes are fundamental domains for the proper implementation, as well as sustainability, of STEM education (especially in Indonesia).","Wahono, Bevo Chang, Chun-Yen",950,"Wahono, B Chang, CY",,"[Wahono, Bevo] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Grad Inst Sci Educ, Taipei 11677, Taiwan.

"This research creates knowledge that addresses gaps in developing sustainability and leadership education by leveraging action research and insider approaches to promote new generations of academics and practitioners. Research arose from student calls for stronger stewardship practice, humanitarian education, and progressive student leadership interested in promoting academic responsibility. Calls were met by constraints from University faculty for rigor. The research applied methodology involved mixed method action research philosophies, sustainability design tools (such as life cycle analysis), participatory and ethnographic exploration of education in the context of Front Range of Colorado, particularly with respect to socioeconomically challenged urban areas, described as two interacting vignettes. Simultaneously, challenges to the applied methodology as action research are framed. It was concluded that action to create more rigorous sustainability education and leadership outcomes is possible given development by mixed frameworks (e.g., via logic models) that can align with larger strategic efforts (e.g., United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization's Global Action Programme). An outcome of this research was the development of a science technology engineering mathematics sustainability science station that is proposed to be a configurable educational resource. It was also concluded that interactions among academic leadership-administration, and professional societies play important roles in upholding student-focused social contracts to support leadership development.

"Twenty years after the compulsory national guidelines of Education for Ethnic-Racial Relations (ERER) were issued, its implementation remains one of the greatest challenges of pre service and in-service teachers education programs in Brazil. The Indigenous School Education (EEI) and Quilombola School Education (EEQ), as differentiated education projects, are not considered in the national scenario either. The main aim of this paper is to present, through a quantitative-qualitative approach, the current situation of the production of knowledge focused on the ERER, the EEI and the EEQ in the Professional Master's in Mathematics in National Network (Profmat). The data reveal that, despite the potentialities implicit in ERER, EEQ and EEI, both differentiated projects are still challenges for Profmat, here seen as an important public policy for the articulation of anti-racist education on the ground of public schools in the country in the field of Mathematics. On a time basis of nine years, we found only six out of 6442 Profmat dissertations that explicitly bring ERER, EEQ or EEI into their theoretical frameworks, which implies that only about 0.09% of the dissertations in Profmat database address, in some way, issues related to education for ethnic-racial relations.","Alves-Brito, Alan Silva, Jeferson Giraldo, Victor Augusto",,"Alves-Brito, A Silva, J Giraldo, VA",107,"[Alves-Brito, Alan] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ciencias, Porto Alegre, RS, Algeria.

"STEM education faces monumental challenges which are aggravated by the Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0 and the current COVID-19 global contagion. These challenges also affect how students learn in the STEM discipline in the senior high school. This qualitative study employed a case research design which sought to investigate nature of the challenges in STEM learning among senior high school students in the Philippines. Semi-structured interview guide was used in gathering the qualitative data from the 20 STEM learners in a government-run secondary school in Zambales, Philippines. Findings showed that the students encountered challenges in the STEM program. Ten themes emerged based on the students' responses. These challenges encountered by the students revolved around three categories - course-related challenges, individual challenges and socio-cultural challenges. The study recommends that schools offering STEM academic strands may reframe and rethink their processes, practices and policies to address the students' challenges in STEM learning. Policy recommendations are also discussed in the paper to equip the students towards the demands of Industrial Revolution 4.0 and in the post-pandemic world.","Rogayan, Danilo V., Jr. Rafanan, Renzo Jay L. de Guzman, Clarisse Yimyr",,"Rogayan, DV Rafanan, RJL de Guzman, CY",232,"[Rogayan, Danilo V., Jr.; Rafanan, Renzo Jay L.; de Guzman, Clarisse Yimyr] President Ramon Magsaysay State Univ San Marcelin, Coll Teacher Educ, Zambales, Philippines.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Challenges in STEM learning; IR 4.0; Post-COVID Era; Post-pandemic World; STEM Education,10.30870/jppi.v7i2.11293,Article,,2477-2038,danrogayan@prmsu.edu.ph,244,,Ramon Magsaysay State University,The researchers would like to thank the President Ramon Magsaysay State University for the support to this research project.

"The 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake, which struck on January 1 during Japan's holiday season, may have led to some delays in response efforts. It is important to acknowledge that many individuals likely responded promptly, and this statement is not intended to criticize the responses of various parties. Another significant challenge was how regions outside the affected area could effectively support those impacted, especially in terms of school education soon after the disaster. This study provides a preliminary report on a school education support project initiated in response to the earthquake. The primary focus is on the centralized information portal site launched on January 3, designed for ""supporting supporters."" Additionally, the study covers the rapid response meeting held on January 9 and the report meeting on May 8, both at the International Research Institute of Disaster Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.

"When pressing societal challenges (e.g., COVID-19, access to clean water) are sidelined in science classrooms, science education fails to leverage the knowledge and experiences of minoritized students in school, thus reproducing injustices in society. Our conceptual framework for justice-centered STEM education engages all students in multiple STEM subjects, including data science and computer science, to explain and design solutions to pressing societal challenges and their disproportionate impact on minoritized groups. In the first part of this article, we extend our conceptual framework by articulating the affordances of justice-centered STEM education for one minoritized student group that has been traditionally denied meaningful STEM learning experiences: multilingual learners (MLs). Justice-centered STEM education with MLs leverages the assets that MLs bring to STEM learning, including their transnational knowledge and experiences as well as their rich repertoire of meaning-making resources, thus refuting deficit narratives of these students. To illustrate the affordances of justice-centered STEM education with MLs, we draw on examples from our instructional unit that engages students in the pressing societal challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second part of the article, we report on an initial inquiry into how 14 undergraduate pre-service teachers made sense of our conceptual framework after participating in lessons from our COVID-19 instructional unit. Findings indicated that pre-service teachers perceived both opportunities and obstacles of justice-centered STEM education with MLs. We close by discussing what it might take to prepare the next generation of teachers to disrupt systemic injustices in and out of school.","Grapin, Scott E.

"STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is a 21st century learning approach that is extremely important to students and children nowadays. Many developed countries have emphasized this approach to early childhood education (ECE). Although there are some challenges in promoting children's cognitive development in preschool, there are some best practices that early childhood educators can use as a guideline in planning, implementing, and evaluating their development at school. Four databases were used to find the best practices consist of Scopus, ERIC, Web of Science, and Science Direct. These databases are consulted to analyze published articles that produce findings on the best practices and challenges of implementing STEM activities that have been recorded either in kindergarten or preschool environments. The findings revealed there were 23 themes for the best practices and 10 themes for challenges that were successfully analyzed. In order to ensure that STEM education can be implemented with better quality in the future, educators should know the best way to implement the activities by practicing the best practices. In addition, educators also need to take action wisely when there are challenges in implementing STEM activities so that children can acquire meaningful experience when participating in the activities.","Ghazali, Azam Ashari, Zakiah Mohamad Hardman, Joanne",,"Ghazali, A Ashari, ZM Hardman, J",,"[Ghazali, Azam; Ashari, Zakiah Mohamad] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Sch Educ, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia.

"Our rapidly changing society needs highly-qualified STEM professionals (experts in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) to develop solutions to the problems it is facing. Many of the students who graduate from a STEM programme in secondary education, however, opt out of STEM when enrolling in higher education, often due to a loss of interest. To ensure sufficiently high and qualified enrolment in higher STEM education, we need to bridge this gap between secondary and higher STEM education by showing our youngsters the relevance of science and technology to their personal life and environment. To this end, the project STEM@school promoted and studied the idea of integrated STEM in secondary education in Flanders, Belgium. In integrated STEM education, learning contents from the separate STEM courses are linked in an authentic way, as they often are in our environmental challenges. This approach encourages students as well as their teachers to acquire a robust understanding of STEM concepts, and a creative, inquisitive, and collaborative mindset. For the design of integrated STEM curricula, STEM@school united secondary-school STEM teachers and university researchers. This article elaborates on the principles, opportunities and challenges of the design and implementation of these curricula and discusses their promising effects on students' conceptual understanding and attitudes towards STEM subjects. The article concludes with tips and tricks to get started with integrated STEM education in secondary schools.","De Meester, Jolien Boeve-de Pauw, Jelle Buyse, Marie-Paule Ceuppens, Stijn De Cock, Mieke De Loof, Haydee Goovaerts, Leen Hellinckx, Luc Knipprath, Heidi Struyf, Annemie Thibaut, Lieve van de Velde, Didier Van Petegem, Peter Dehaene, Wim",PII S1062798720000964,"De Meester, J Boeve-de Pauw, J Buyse, MP Ceuppens, S De Cock, M De Loof, H Goovaerts, L Hellinckx, L Knipprath, H Struyf, A Thibaut, L van de Velde, D Van Petegem, P Dehaene, W",S135,"[De Meester, Jolien] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Engn Sci, BE-3000 Leuven, Belgium.

"This article presents a retrospective autoethnopoetic study exploring a queer student's journey in Australian tertiary STEM education, employing queer research methodologies to illuminate the challenges encountered. Through personal narrative and poetic expression, we identify critical themes: microaggressions, discrimination, identity formation, cisheteronormative navigation, and resilience strategies. Although rooted in the first author's experiences, these insights reflect broader issues prevalent among queer students in STEM, such as the impact of discrimination and microaggressions on academic performance and well-being. This study underscores the significance of queer theory and autoethnopoetic methods in challenging normative assumptions in STEM education research, contributing to a deeper understanding of the queer academic experience. It advocates for the development of inclusive and supportive educational policies aimed at enhancing the learning environment for queer students, emphasising the need for visibility, representation, and support systems within STEM disciplines.","Kairns, Philip lisahunter Lambert, Karen",,"Kairns, P lisahunter Lambert, K",114,"[Kairns, Philip; lisahunter; Lambert, Karen] Monash Univ, Fac Educ, Sch Curriculum Teaching & Inclus Educ, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

"Emotional feeling is a phase of neurobiological activity that plays an important role in cognitive thinking and learning, although largely overlooked in complex tutoring fields like Mathematics. This paper introduces an innovative e-learning Mathematics course integrating emojis as a feedback mechanism to express students' emotional responses towards mathematical challenges. By providing a platform for intuitive emotional expression, this approach aims to strengthen engagement and comprehension. Through empirical investigation, emotional reactions of online mathematics students are explored, with attention to gender-related differences in emoji usage. A survey administered to 100 students prompts them to select emojis conveying their sentiments towards mathematical problems. Statistical analyses reveal that emojis effectively capture students' emotions, with an emphasis on gender-based variations in selection. These insights illuminate the dynamics of emotional expression and hold implications for fostering comprehensive learning environments that mitigate negative emotions such as mathematical anxiety. By empowering educators to monitor students' emotional reactions and adapt teaching strategies accordingly, this approach has the potential to cultivate confident and proficient learners essential for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) advancement.","Zarkadoulas, Dimitrios Virvou, Maria",,"Zarkadoulas, D Virvou, M",1181,"[Zarkadoulas, Dimitrios; Virvou, Maria] Univ Piraeus, Dept Informat, 80 M Karaoli & Dimitriou, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",University of Piraeus,,,,,2025-01-19,E-learning; online education; gender studies; teaching techniques; secondary school students; user modelling; affective; computing; sentiment analysis; emojis; mathematics; STEM; mathematics anxiety,10.3233/IDT-240170,Article,,1875-8843,dzarkadoulas@unipi.gr,1201,,,,XS6X7,MATH ANXIETY; VIRTUAL-REALITY; EMOTICONS,2,INTELL DECIS TECHNOL,Intell.

"In STEM education, a thorough understanding of the interaction of self-efficacy and metacognitive monitoring behaviors is needed to refine theories and inform the design of instructional supports for students with varying levels of motivation and self-regulation skills. We examined how students' (n = 1063) exam scores in an un-dergraduate life science course were influenced by their self-efficacy and online metacognitive monitoring be-haviors by integrating variable-centered and person-centered approaches. In a semester-long study, students' self-efficacy judgements made at the end of the semester were stronger predictors of students' final exam per-formance than those made at the beginning of the semester. Results further suggested that the influence of self-efficacy on exam scores decreased as online monitoring behaviors increased. Students' prior GPA predicted membership in three latent profiles indicated by 1) high self-efficacy with high metacognitive monitoring ac-tivity; 2) high self-efficacy with low metacognitive monitoring activity; and 3) low self-efficacy with low met-acognitive monitoring activity. Learners with high self-efficacy and high monitoring activity outperformed those with high self-efficacy and low monitoring, who outperformed those with low self-efficacy and low monitoring on exams.","Huang, Xing Bernacki, Matthew L.

"Although institutions of higher education have placed a large emphasis on increasing the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students matriculating in higher education, the disparities in STEM retention and graduation rates between URM and non-URM students emphasize the dire need for increased support to help URM students navigate challenges including stereotype threat, impostor phenomenon, and lack of social connectedness that disproportionately affect URM students in majority-dominated fields. Prior research has demonstrated that structured mentoring has the potential to generate substantial improvements in academic, social, and career outcomes for URM STEM students. In particular, network-based mentoring approaches that allow for students to receive both professional and peer mentoring, as well as the opportunity to mentor other students, have demonstrated success in this realm. In this article, we discuss how the current state of academia often fails URM STEM students and faculty, review literature regarding the ways in which structured mentoring approaches can alleviate barriers to success among URM groups in STEM fields, and offer recommendations regarding how academic institutions can successfully implement holistic student and faculty mentoring programs.","Markle, Robert S.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented challenges for working conditions for scientists, but little is known for how the associations of these challenges with scientists' mental health and productivity differ by sex and status as a parent. This online survey study in six languages collected data from 4,494 scientists in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine fields across 132 countries during October-December 2021. We compared the type of challenges for work, changes in work hours, and perception in productivity during the pandemic by sex and status as a parent (children < 18 years living at home). Regression analyses analyzed the impacts of changed working conditions and work-life factors on productivity and mental health. We found that the percentage of participants with increased work hours was the highest in female participants, especially without children. Disproportionately higher increases in work hours were found for teaching and administration in women than men and for research/fundraising in non-parent participants than parent participants (p-value< 0.001). Female participants were more concerned about the negative impacts of the pandemic on publications and long-term career progress, and less satisfied with their career progress than their male counterparts. There were differences in the type of institutional actions for the pandemic across study regions. The identified obstacles for work and home-life factors were associated with higher risks of experiencing depression, anxiety, and stress. Decision makers should consider the gender differences in the pandemic's adverse impacts on productivity in establishing equitable actions for career progress for scientists during pandemics.","Heo, Seulkee Peralta, Pedro Diaz Jin, Lan Nunes, Claudia Ribeiro Pereira Bell, Michelle L.",e0269834,"Heo, S Peralta, PD Jin, L Nunes, CRP Bell, ML",,"[Heo, Seulkee; Peralta, Pedro Diaz; Nunes, Claudia Ribeiro Pereira; Bell, Michelle L.] Yale Univ, Sch Environm, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.

"The application of extended reality (XR) technology in education has been growing for the last two decades. XR offers immersive and interactive visualization experiences that can enhance learning by making it engaging. Recent technological advances have led to the availability of high-quality and affordable XR headsets. These advancements have spurred a wave of research focused on designing, implementing, and validating XR educational interventions. Limited literature focuses on the recent trends of XR within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Thus, this paper presents an umbrella review that explores the exploding field of XR and its transformative potential in STEM education. Using six online databases, the review zoomed in on 17 out of 1972 papers on XR for STEM education, published between 2020 and 2023, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The results highlighted the types of XR technology applied (i.e., virtual reality and augmented reality), the specific STEM disciplines involved, the focus of each study reviewed, and the major findings from recent reviews. Overall, the educational benefits of using XR technology in STEM education are apparent: XR boosts student motivation, facilitates learning engagement, and improves skills, for example. However, using XR in education still has challenges that must be addressed, such as the physical discomfort of the learner wearing the XR headset and technical glitches. Besides revealing trends of using XR in STEM education, this umbrella review encourages reflection on current practices and suggests ways to apply XR to STEM education effectively.","Zhang, Yiqun Feijoo-Garcia, Miguel A.

"The integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) into educational systems has grown rapidly in international research. The literature reports on policies, experiences, and programs focused on interdisciplinary STEM integration around the world, as well as the challenges that the approach represents for the integration processes that teachers may undertake. Teachers, then, play a key role in the implementation of STEM Education in the school system. This systematic literature review analyzed the strategies for STEM Education of future mathematics and science teachers and the purposes for which they have been incorporated in both research and teacher education. The review considered peer-reviewed studies published in the period 2012-2021 written in Spanish, English, and Portuguese. The review followed a three-step process: planning, conducting and reporting the review. The results show the roles that STEM Education has played in teacher education, both in research and the design of preparation programs. The methodological strategies for preparing future teachers are also reported. Finally, the review provides evidence of the opportunities offered by including STEM Education approaches in early teacher education, regarding the impact on their perceptions, conceptual knowledge, self- efficacy, and future practices.","Castrillon-Yepes, Alexander Lebrun-Llano, Valeria",348447,"Castrillón-Yepes, A Lebrun-Llano, V",,"[Castrillon-Yepes, Alexander] Univ Antioquia, Escuela Normal Super Senor Milagros, Medellin, Colombia.

"This study aims to explore how education has adapted and transformed the educational environment during the Covid-19 pandemic in the perspective and facing the diversity of indigenous teachers and their intercultural relations. Thus, this is a socially relevant study as there is an urgent need to include indigenous school education on the agenda of discussions about the pandemic and its future impacts. It is in this way that we seek to gather information to answer the following research questions: What is the impact of the pandemic on the education of indigenous peoples? What are the future consequences of this pandemic crisis for indigenous school education? We chose some bibliographic and documentary studies to develop the research, mostly based on contributions of recognized authors, such as: Baniwa (2006); Grupioni (2011); Cury (2007); Hodges (2021); Morais (2021). These studies lead us to conclude that it is important to reflect about the state of indigenous education in the country after this pandemic and to look to the future of indigenous school education in order to update teaching practices and transform them into the same conditions of changes as non -indigenous schools.","Andrade, Joana D'Arc Alves Paes Santos, Jocyleia Santana dos Rodrigues, Rodrigo Gouveia",,"Andrade, JDAP Santos, JSD Rodrigues, RG",230,"[Andrade, Joana D'Arc Alves Paes] Univ Fed do Tocantins UFT, Mestre em Educ pelo Programa Pos Graduacao em Educ, Palmas, Brazil.

"In response to longstanding inequities and injustices within STEM, this review addresses the pressing need to decolonize STEM education and redefine the purpose of its disciplinary fields. Focusing on the influence of entrenched power structures, particularly the military-industrial complex, this review examines the relatively under-theorized impact of these forces on shaping the goals and scope of certain bodies of STEM education within UK higher education. The first section offers an overview of militarized STEM education and its connections to the challenges of decolonization. The second section explores strategies and interventions for decolonial pedagogy aimed at challenging discourses and practices that reinforce colonial and militarized narratives within curriculum and teaching. This review highlights how critical pedagogy and Indigenous Knowledge Systems offer educators' methods to cultivate criticality and humanity in their teaching practices. Ultimately, the review attempts to highlight how STEM education can be re-envisioned to serve broader, more emancipatory, and just purposes. Here the review advocates for a transformative educational paradigm that integrates inclusive pedagogical interventions with critical engagement in the ethical and moral dimensions of STEM practice, with the overarching goal of advancing social justice in teaching practices.","Porter, Sean Siddiqui, Yusra",1480199,"Porter, S Siddiqui, Y",,"[Porter, Sean] Univ Exeter, Educ & Acad Serv, Exeter, England.

"The demand for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills has been consistently increasing due to technological advancements and globalization, making STEM education and teacher training a critical priority. Although many national and international initiatives have been implemented to strengthen STEM education and raise the attractiveness of the teaching profession, a shortage of teachers in general, and STEM teachers in particular, is still evident across Europe. This study aimed to identify factors contributing to attracting existing and potential teachers to careers in STEM education. Qualitative research methods were employed to study teachers' perceived motivation, challenges, and suggestions regarding STEM teachers' careers, competence, and collaboration development. The study revealed that the practical application of competence development initiatives significantly motivates STEM teachers, emphasizing the importance of aligning professional development with classroom implementation. These results emphasize the importance of prioritizing practical, classroom-oriented professional development and fostering a culture of collaboration in educational institutions.","Juskeviciene, Anita Jevsikova, Tatjana Stupuriene, Gabriele Vinikiene, Lina",780,"Juskeviciene, A Jevsikova, T Stupuriene, G Vinikiene, L",,"[Juskeviciene, Anita; Jevsikova, Tatjana; Stupuriene, Gabriele; Vinikiene, Lina] Vilnius Univ, Inst Educ Sci, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania.

"Multi-institutional STEM reform networks have become a popular way to address the challenges facing undergraduate STEM education. Despite an intuitive sense that networks are effective reform mechanisms, few empirical research studies have investigated their impact. This qualitative case study examined the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL), a network of 38 universities that seeks to advance undergraduate STEM education through the preparation of future faculty. Using a case study design involving qualitative network maps and semi-structured interviews, this study investigated the inter- and intra-organizational boundary-spanning behaviors of key institutional representatives who link their campus to the CIRTL Network. Findings indicate that institutional representatives engaged in finding, diffusion, translation, and gaining institutional support behaviors in service to enhancing and expanding their local CIRTL programming. Results and a proposed boundary-spanning framework demonstrate the potential that such behaviors have in helping to advance post-secondary STEM education.","Hill, Lucas B.",,"Hill, LB",455,"[Hill, Lucas B.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Ctr Educ Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education reform; higher education reform networks; boundary-spanners,10.1080/00221546.2019.1650581,Article,,1538-4640,lhill6@wisc.edu,482,,,,LF6MN,KNOWLEDGE; COLLABORATION; PERFORMANCE; COMMUNITIES; CONSORTIA; DESIGN,3,J HIGH EDUC-UK,J.

"Environmental challenges of the Anthropocene are synergistic and interdisciplinary, complicating the ability of scientists to effectively communicate to the public. This complexity illuminates the limitations of traditional Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education, as students frequently have difficulty applying their coursework towards contextualizing the novel problems that accompany global change. We view these challenges as educational opportunities to prepare STEM students for the adaptive learning necessary in the Anthropocene. Through careful attention to course pedagogy, instructors can facilitate student learning about global change and science communication, and teach students to act as bridges across the science-policy gap. Here we discuss our university course, in which students translated The Scientific Consensus on Maintaining Humanity's Life Support Systems in the 21st Century into a communication product, an ArcGIS Story Map entitled 'Geographic Impacts of Global Change: Mapping the Stories of Californians'. Incorporating such real-world science translation into STEM education is critical for preparing our new generation of socially responsible scientists and citizens of the Anthropocene.","Mychajliw, Alexis M.

"Despite their intellectual potential, students with learning disabilities (LDs) face enormous challenges in science. Drawing on the literature from special, inclusive, and science education, this paper illuminates the promises and challenges of supporting students with LDs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. In light of the insights from research in these diverse fields, this work offers a comprehensive framework to understand and address the unique needs of students with LDs in STEM learning. This multidimensional analysis provides an overview of the contemporary discourses on STEM education, presents the continuing controversies surrounding the conceptualization of LDs, and discusses the barriers to the inclusion of students with LDs in science classrooms. Because difficulties in cognitive processing are thought to underlie LDs, this paper particularly focuses on the cognitive impediments to the achievement of students with LDs in problem-based STEM learning tasks and shares effective interventions to support these students' cognitive development.","Asghar, Anila Sladeczek, Ingrid E.

"A career in systems science offers exciting prospects as well as challenges around the world, which are often underexplored or unknown. Gender parity, diversity, inclusion, and equity are essential for knowledge production, systems science research, and innovation to be representative, democratic, and critically informed. By virtue of its focus on systems, omics science is ideally poised to understand and respond to systemic and structural issues that hinder gender parity, equity, and democracy in science and society. In this context, voices from women in systems science in resource-limited countries are often inaudible, a gap that this article aims to bridge. We present here some of the pressing issues and possible ways forward for equitable representation of women in science. We highlight emerging frontiers of systems science such as digital transformation, Industry 4.0, and cyber-physical systems where gender parity and equity are crucial. This article also examines some of the challenges faced by women scientists in Africa. All in all, much work is needed across communities and countries worldwide for diversity and gender equity in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM)-based programs. Adapting a critical lens that examines power asymmetries in STEM in Africa and around the world, and new ways of thinking for bringing women scientists in Africa to leadership positions in traditional STEM fields such as computer science and engineering where large gender equity gaps exist, is a timely and principled necessity in 21st century science and society.","Hamdi, Yosr Mulder, Nicola Abdelhak, Sonia",,"Hamdi, Y Mulder, N Abdelhak, S",329,"[Hamdi, Yosr; Abdelhak, Sonia] Univ Tunis Manar, Inst Pasteur Tunis, Lab Biomed Genom & Oncogenet, Tunis, Tunisia.

"Augmented reality (AR) technology has potential advantages for application in STEM education. However, existing relevant studies lack a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of AR on student achievement in STEM education. In this study, a meta-analysis of 33 studies published in eight SSCI journals of educational technology between 2010 and 2023 found that AR had a moderate impact (ES = 0.586) on student achievement in STEM fields, and the overall impact tended to increase gradually over time across years. Analysis of the six moderator variables revealed that AR had a more positive effect on student achievement in science and math, and that its intervention effects were better in primary and lower secondary education. The positive effects of AR were better with the integration of tablet and smartphone-like mobile devices. AR was predominantly multimedia-based in presenting STEM-related content, but integration of other pedagogical approaches had the potential to achieve better results. AR had the strongest contribution to student STEM achievement when the duration of the experiment was 1 week-1 month. In informal environments, AR was more effective in terms of intervening in student achievement in STEM education. Finally, this study offers some suggestions for future research and application of AR in STEM education.","Wang, Xiao-Ming Yu, Dan-Dan Yu, Xiao-Han Hwang, Gwo-Jen Li, Feiming",,"Wang, XM Yu, DD Yu, XH Hwang, GJ Li, FM",20547,"[Wang, Xiao-Ming; Li, Feiming] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Zhejiang Key Lab Intelligent Educ Technol & Applic, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is increasingly viewed as a vehicle for global dominance and a panacea to economic downturns, environmental challenges, and food security. However, divergences in STEM education agendas at regional and national levels imply disparities in policy formulation and implementation in the Global North and Global South. This study sought to explore what informs the drivers of STEM education in the two geo-economic blocks with a view to understanding contextual factors that inform practice. A focus on STEM education in the Global North and Global South becomes necessary, given the widespread calls for collaborative work, for example, shared interests in addressing sustainable development goals, and research on the COVID-19 pandemic. A theoretical approach, based on a review of relevant literature, was adopted. Ideology critique informed the analysis and was used to make sense of the salient themes. In the Global North, STEM education is historically driven by ambitions of political dominance, the need to curb economic slumps and address critical skills shortages, and growing desire for extra-terrestrial colonization. Within this context we argue that a neoliberal agenda drives the STEM education enterprise. In the Global South, massification with equity dominates policy formulation and implementation as countries battle to redress past colonial imbalances. The Global South countries generally sign up to regional and global STEM education agendas but financial constraints compounded by an unabated brain drain result in stagnation at policy adoption at vocational level. Convenient partnerships are increasingly fashionable as countries in the Global North seek to exploit the geographical advantage of those in the Global South in order to fully utilise the extra-terrestrial space, resources for biomedical science and indigenous natural resources, among others. Collaboration endeavors between the Global North and Global South need to be mutually beneficial. The Global North needs to redistribute the aspects of power it holds in relation to STEM to move towards more equitable policies and practices across these geopolitical realms. We recommend greater vocationalisation of STEM education hinged on STEM integration with the humanities in the Global South and balanced, mutually beneficial STEM collaboration endeavors with the Global North countries.","Mudaly, Ronicka Chirikure, Tamirirofa",1144399,"Mudaly, R Chirikure, T",,"[Mudaly, Ronicka] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Educ, Sci & Technol Educ Cluster, Durban, South Africa.

"Community psychology takes an explicitly political stance by identifying where power lies and how it is exercised in ways that maintain privilege and discrimination against particular groups. From this perspective, we consider the challenges facing school education in South Africa today. Education is positioned as an important site for the liberation and well-being of our country's majority. However, the state of education is marked by persistent inequalities. From a Foucauldian perspective, this paper presents a meta-synthesis of school education literature and identifies prominent discourses circulating around the country's basic education sector: the discourses of democracy, human rights, and good governance; rights; development; scarce skills; the crisis in education; and privatisation are discussed. We consider the role of these discourses in the wider social processes of legitimation and power in education, and subjective implications for youth. We note the various ways in which discourses responsibilise youth and surrounding stakeholders, and how others position them as resources for the neoliberal capitalist economy. We argue for the role of counter-discourses and a collective emancipatory","Msomi, Nqobile Nomonde Akhurst, Jacqueline",,"Msomi, NN Akhurst, J",98,"[Msomi, Nqobile Nomonde; Akhurst, Jacqueline] Rhodes Univ, Fac Humanities, Psychol Dept, Makhanda, South Africa.",Rhodes University,,,,,2025-01-19,community psychology; school education; Foucauldian discourse; educational transformation; discourse in education,10.17159/2520-9868/i92a06,Article,,2520-9868,nqobilemsomi08@gmail.com; j.akhurst@ru.ac.za,114,,,,X1QT5,SCHOOL,92,J EDUC-S AFR,J.

"For some professionally, vocationally, or technically oriented careers, curricula delivered in higher education establishments may focus on teaching material related to a single discipline. By contrast, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary teaching (MITT) results in improved affective and cognitive learning and critical thinking, offering learners/students the opportunity to obtain a broad general knowledge base. Chemistry is a discipline that sits at the interface of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) subjects (and those aligned with or informed by STEMM subjects). This article discusses the significant potential of inclusion of chemistry in MITT activities in higher education and the real-world importance in personal, organizational, national, and global contexts. It outlines the development and implementation challenges attributed to legacy higher education infrastructures (that call for creative visionary leadership with strong and supportive management and administrative functions), and curriculum design that ensures inclusivity and collaboration and is pitched and balanced appropriately. It concludes with future possibilities, notably highlighting that chemistry, as a discipline, underpins industries that have multibillion dollar turnovers and employ millions of people across the world.","Hardy, John G.

"This article characterizes and evaluates the development of an accredited, in-house faculty-based teaching recognition scheme aimed at supporting clinicians and academics to achieve Advance HE Fellowship recognition. The scheme takes 6 to 24 months to complete and forms part of an institution-wide scheme. The evaluation covered 44 months collecting data on participation rates across the school and 21 semi-structured interviews across 16 staff participants. We describe the outcomes measured alongside key perceived benefits and challenges to support the implementation of similar schemes elsewhere. Across 130 academic staff, there was 61% engagement. In interviews, 11 participants characterized benefits in terms of changes to their teaching, such as adopting new strategies for differing class sizes, and highlighted the benefit of accessible and context-specific development opportunities designed specifically for STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine) practitioners and clinicians.

"The tensions and challenges facing business education frame this paper, which takes a critical look at the historical evolution of business school education in the context of the present conjecture, with a particular emphasis on the role social theory can play in the analysis of strategy and ethics. Flyvbjerg's phronesis and Selznick's sociology are deployed to address the challenges facing business schools and their place in higher education. Kant's moral anthropology opens common grounds to both approaches. Our aim is to provide a platform from which business and university leaders can debate and discuss the current and future role and impact of business school education, particularly focusing on linking and cultivating ethical and strategic capabilities in management and organizational practices.","Clegg, Stewart R.

"This article seeks to reflect on the process of Stateization of Indigenous School Education in the state of Pernambuco and the challenges for the development of an intercultural curriculum for indigenous schools. Our reflection was carried out from the theoretical approaches of: Lopes (2004), Santiago (1998), among others. In the methodological path we used a critical ethnographic perspective (GEERTZ, 2002; FABIAN, 2013; CLIFFORD, 2002) and in the data collection process we worked with a dialogical perspective (CRAPANZANO, 1991). In this sense, based on the reflections carried out, it is possible to understand that there is a clear difficulty on the part of the State in recognizing intercultural indigenous schools as epistemic spaces and the indigenous peoples who inhabit them as producers of knowledge.","de Assis Ferreira, Diana Cibele Cunha, Katia Silva",,"Ferreira, DCD Cunha, KS",29,"[de Assis Ferreira, Diana Cibele] UFPE PPGE, Educ, Recife, PE, Brazil.

"The Australian Science and Mathematics School (ASMS) is a purpose-built innovative senior secondaly school situated on the grounds of Flinders University, South Australia. The school was established to address declining enrollments in senior secondaly mathematics and science, students' negative attitudes, a shortage of qualified science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers, and a curriculum that lacked relevance to contemporaly life. Such research evidence called for transformation in STEM education and acknowledged that teachers' professional learning was central to achieving transformation. A key professional learning strategy employed by the school to transform STEM education was the engagement of teachers and academics as professional partners in developing interdisciplinaly curriculum. The value and challenges of the professional partnership are explored in this article, noting the importance of valuing rather than dismissing dissonance between the groups.","Bissaker, Kerry",,"Bissaker, K",55,"[Bissaker, Kerry] Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",Flinders University South Australia,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1080/00405841.2014.862124,Article,,,kerry.bissaker@flinders.edu.au,63,,,,287WE,,1,THEOR PRACT,Theory Pract.,English,,21,,"Bissaker, Kerry/0000-0002-8008-3744","341 RAMSEYER HALL, 29 W WOODRUFF AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210-1177 USA",,9,COLUMBUS,,,J,"OHIO STATE UNIV, COLLEGE EDUCATION",2014,"Bissaker, Kerry/AAN-3354-2021","Bissaker, K (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Educ, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",Education & Educational Research,SI,0040-5841,THEORY INTO PRACTICE,,,23,Transforming STEM Education in an Innovative Australian School: The Role of Teachers' and Academics' Professional Partnerships,2,43,WOS:000329572200008,53,,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),35
"During the last decade, different values, tools and practices promoted by maker culture have been adopted in formal educational settings with the aim of reinvigorating Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. Higher education institutions (HEIs) have also engaged with maker culture to explore its potentialities regarding education, entrepreneurship and innovation. However, these collaborations with various stakeholders are not always smooth and educators need to deal with significant challenges that arise in these engagements, despite the problem-solving learning opportunities that they can offer their students. This paper presents the results of a case study that dealt with these issues through the establishment of an open and collaborative learning ecosystem (OCLE) between different educators, students and external stakeholders. The empirical work was based on thirty-three semi-structured interviews across four countries, eight focus groups and a final participatory workshop. The study argues that maker culture can offer several potentialities for pushing forward an integrative vision of STEM education as well as other disciplines from social sciences and humanities. An emphasis is placed on how tertiary education can benefit greatly from the adoption of OCLEs and how these communities of practices can encourage an education oriented to meeting societal challenges. The paper also warns that these kinds of interventions face significant organisational challenges in HEIs that demand significant institutional recognition and support to overcome this organisational resistance.","Tabares, Raul Boni, Alejandra",,"Tabarés, R Boni, A",241,"[Tabares, Raul] Basque Res & Technol Alliance, TECNALIA, Parque Cient & Tecnol Bizkaia,Astondo Bidea, E-48160 Derio, Spain.

"The young generation is expected to address current development challenges. The main challenge of sustainable development is the problem of waste management and recycling. To promote long-term sustainability, it is crucial to equip youth with contemporary knowledge and skills and to change their daily habits. The Circular Economy (CE) has become a key concept in responding to unsustainable resource use and waste management globally. At the same time, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education is an innovative teaching approach to promote learners' capacity for self-direction, problem-solving, collaboration, and management. This paper argues the role of STEM education in connecting science with society, the benefits of teaching CE in promoting sustainable consumption and production behaviors, and the potential integration of CE into STEM education through real-world context inquiry and real-world problem-solving. It also presents the case of Vietnam, where integration of STEM education and CE in secondary schools is crucial for a CE toward sustainable development. Questionnaire surveys with 873 secondary school teachers and semi-structured interviews with 54 were conducted during the integrated STEM professional trainings. The aims were to examine teachers' perspectives on the relevance of STEM education and CE to sustainable development and their behaviors toward integrating CE concepts into daily STEM teaching activities. The findings showed a high perception of STEM teachers on the relevance of CE with STEM teaching, the Vietnam context, its interestingness, and the importance of integrating CE into STEM education. Surveyed teachers have also voluntarily integrated development issues and CE principles into STEM teaching. Including CE in STEM education in secondary education offers a promising opportunity to foster more profound societal change toward sustainable development, which contributes to SDG4 - equitable and quality education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles and SDG 12.5 - reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse.","Nguyen, Thi Phuoc Lai",1063755,"Nguyen, TPL",,"[Nguyen, Thi Phuoc Lai] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Dept Dev & Sustainabil, Klongluang, Pathum Thani, Thailand.",Asian Institute of Technology,,,,,2025-01-19,real-world context; problem-based learning; development issues; CE principles; secondary education teachers; transdisciplinary; Vietnam,10.3389/feduc.2023.1063755,Article,,2504-284X,phuoclai@ait.asia,,,,,9Z7JK,SUSTAINABILITY; UNIVERSITIES; TEACHERS; SCHOOL,,FRONT EDUC,Front.

"With increasing focus on primary curricular reform in Ireland, there is a growing recognition of the significance of early childhood education. As a result, professional development organisations are now examining the effectiveness of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education for young children. This study investigates how teachers in a multi-grade primary school initially approached teaching integrated STEM lessons to children aged 4-7 years. Over the course of one school year, three teachers engaged in four cycles of lesson study. Through an action research approach, the researchers collected qualitative data from interviews, lesson plans, collaborative weekly meetings and observation sheets. The study identified difficulties associated with the teachers' limited comprehension of integrated STEM education and demonstrated how the Engineering Design Process helped to mitigate these challenges. The findings offer valuable insights into the knowledge requirements involved in developing children's 21st century skills. The research concluded that teachers enhanced children's STEM learning by providing opportunities for them to explore their curiosity, make predictions and experiment through open-ended play experiences.","Flanagan, Bridget Hourigan, Mairead Leavy, Aisling",,"Flanagan, B Hourigan, M Leavy, A",556,"[Flanagan, Bridget] Marino Inst Educ, Dublin, Ireland.

"The effective implementation of STEM education relies on qualified and well-educated teachers who employ good practices for integrated STEM education. Quality STEM education equips children with the necessary skills to address 21st-century challenges, playing a critical role in developing critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, problem-solving, and responsibility. In this context, preschool and primary school teachers were recommended to attend STEM Professional Development (PD). This study aimed to determine the impact of the EarlySTEM Leader Teacher PD Program on teachers' ability to design STEM lesson plans, using mixed method. Researchers analyzed the STEM lesson plans prepared by preschool and primary school teachers (n=33) who participated in the integrated STEM PD program. All participants who met the graduation criteria were included in the study. The plans were evaluated using the Authentic Problems of Knowledge Society (APoKS) rubric. The findings showed that the Integrated STEM PD program positively influenced teachers' lesson planning skills, specifically when writing the APoKS.

"Sustainable science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education involves lifelong education in various domains. Active learning strategies are receiving increased attention as an important tool, and particularly online-based formative assessment interfaces, although challenges to their use remain in sustainable and flipped STEM education. In this research, we observed pre-service teachers' (PSTs') performance and motivation in a university STEM course that was planned as a randomized examination of 71 students during a 2017/2018 course with an online interface for sustainable and flipped formative assessment. In terms of PSTs' standardized performance and the motivation effect survey, we gathered and examined the data to observe pre- and post-test results on adaptive assignments. Additionally, feedback from/to instructors and their log records were recorded by the proposed interface. The results demonstrate the PSTs' positive performance and motivation, and the feedback and log records reiterate its positive influence with 98.6% participation in the sustainable and flipped online formative assessment interface. Consequently, the foremost drawbacks and challenges that current and traditional STEM education are facing are meaningfully reflected by the results obtained. Thus, the platform allows PSTs to be more involved in experimental contexts and validates learning performance, and the motivations effect survey provides a sustainable and active learning methodology for their future profession.","Jeong, Jin Su Gonzalez-Gomez, David Yllana Prieto, Felix",283,"Jeong, JS González-Gómez, D Prieto, FY",,"[Jeong, Jin Su; Gonzalez-Gomez, David; Yllana Prieto, Felix] Univ Extremadura, Dept Didact Ciencias Expt & Matemat, Ave Univ S-N, Caceres 10004, Spain.",Universidad de Extremadura,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM; formative assessment; sustainability; flipped classroom; adaptive assignment; PSTs; online teaching and learning; feedback,10.3390/educsci10100283,Article,,2227-7102,jin@unex.es; dggomez@unex.es; feyllanap@unex.es,,,"Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain [EDU2016-77007-R]; Consejereria de Economia e Infraestructura y FEDER [IB18004, GR18004]","The authors gratefully acknowledge project EDU2016-77007-R (AEI/FEDER, UE) of the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain, and Consejereria de Economia e Infraestructura y FEDER (Projects IB18004 and GR18004) that made this research possible.",OL5KJ,STUDENTS; MATHEMATICS; TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; SYSTEM,10,EDUC SCI,Educ.

"The emerging value of STEM in society puts demands on Chinese kindergarten teachers to involve STEM teaching in play-based settings. As reported in the literature, societal expectations regarding kindergarten STEM education pose challenges for teachers, who often do not feel adequately prepared in STEM knowledge. This lack of preparation may indicate a lack of confidence and competence in STEM teaching among teachers. To study Chinese kindergarten teachers' confidence and competence in STEM teaching, we conducted an educational experiment where researchers and teachers collaborated on this problem. Our study identified that teachers experienced two micro-crises in STEM teaching. The first was ""what to teach"" and the second was ""how to teach"". The findings highlighted that the primary challenges faced by the focused teachers were because a lack of STEM teaching experience, rather than lack of STEM knowledge as argued in the literature. The educational experiment created a social situation that supports teachers' STEM teaching experience in play. Through the educational experiment, STEM teaching becomes personally meaningful for teachers, which contributes to promoting their confidence and competence in STEM education.","Wang, Yuejiu Li, Liang Fleer, Marilyn Ma, Yuwen",100842,"Wang, YJ Li, L Fleer, M Ma, YW",,"[Wang, Yuejiu] Northeast Normal Univ, Fac Educ, Changchun, Peoples R China.

"In times of rapid technological innovation and global challenges, the development of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) competencies becomes important. They improve the personal scientific literacy of citizens, enhance international economic competitiveness and are an essential foundation for responsible citizenship, including the ethical custodianship of our planet. The latest programme for international student assessment results, however, indicate that even in economically mature countries such as those in Europe, and the USA and Australia, approximately 20% of students lack sufficient skills in mathematics or science. This trend serves to highlight the urgent need for action in relation to STEM education. While it is widely acknowledged that mathematics underpins all other STEM disciplines, there is clear evidence it plays an understated role in integrated STEM education. In this article, we address an element of this concern by examining the role of mathematics within STEM education and how it might be advanced through three interdisciplinary approaches: (1) twenty-first century skills; (2) mathematical modelling; and (3) education for responsible citizenship. At the end of the paper we discuss the potential for research in relation to these three aspects and point to what work needs to be done in the future.","Maass, Katja Geiger, Vince Romero Ariza, Marta Goos, Merrilyn",,"Maass, K Geiger, V Ariza, MR Goos, M",869,"[Maass, Katja] Univ Educ Freiburg, Int Ctr STEM Educ, Freiburg, Germany.

"STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education has become a global focus to foster learners' Twenty first-century skills and achieve the sustainable development of society. Design challenges present children with a real-world design problem to solve, as design challenges inspire children to think creatively and apply STEM-related principles or skills to develop a solution. However, there is a lack of research on implementing STEM design challenges in the context of early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, the in-depth case study aimed to investigate the implementation of Story-based STEM Design Challenges in a Chinese kindergarten, involving 12 teachers and 164 children. A total of six classrooms participated in the Story-based STEM Design Challenge training workshop and implementation, lasting for 3 months. Data was collected from multiple sources, including videotaped classroom observations, teacher interviews, and related pedagogical documents. The findings of the study showed that children's emotional engagement, attentive engagement, and behavioral engagement varied during their participation. Teachers used various strategies to scaffold children's learning throughout the preparation, implementation, and evaluation stages. This study hoped to provide valuable insights into effective STEM pedagogy and offer evidence for the implementation of design challenges in early childhood STEM education.","Zhou, Wenhui Yang, Weipeng",,"Zhou, WH Yang, WP",,"[Zhou, Wenhui; Yang, Weipeng] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Early Childhood Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; Engineering design process; Maker education; STEM design challenges; Early childhood education,10.1007/s10643-024-01733-6,Article; Early Access,AUG 2024,1573-1707,Zhouwh0966@gmail.com,,,,"We would like to appreciate the Chinese kindergarten principals, teachers and children who voluntarily took part in the study.",C4Y2F,TRIANGULATION; THINKING,,EARLY CHILD EDUC J,Early Child.

"Despite their advanced status, nations such as the United States of America continue to face a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) crisis in their education system. Lack of effective teaching modalities that can leverage real-world examples to stimulate student interest in STEM concepts are identified as one of the reasons for this crisis. To address these challenges, our research is investigating the use of innovative and attractive modeling and simulation frameworks for concurrent, interactive and collaborative STEM education where vehicular traffic serves as the real-world example to reify STEM concepts. Existing traffic-related tools, such as traffic simulators, however, do not provide: (1) intuitive abstractions to construct, refine, and simulate various traffic models that are commensurate to the level of high school students, (2) concurrent and scalable model execution, and (3) collaborative learning environments. On the other hand, although intuitive abstractions such as Google Maps exist, these abstractions do not support semantics for dynamic behavior, which is representative of real-world traffic scenarios. To overcome both these challenges and address the STEM problem, this paper presents a Cloud-based, Collaborative, and Scaled-up Modeling and Simulation Framework for STEM Education called C2SuMo. The key contribution of this paper lies in the design and implementation of a cloud-based, elastic modeling and simulation framework that provides an intuitive, model-driven, collaborative, and concurrent visual simulation environment for STEM education. The paper also reports on insights we gained conducting a user study involving over sixty high school students. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper attempted to ascertain the levels of self-efficacy and anxiety of mathematics among upper secondary students in Malaysia. A descriptive survey study was conducted with 842 secondary students. Instrument consisted of 29 attributes. Attributes' ratings were analysed using Fuzzy Conjoint Analysis (FCA). Results attested that students' mathematics self-efficacy was low and their anxiety was high. Findings also suggested that students' high anxiety is a consequence of their low self-efficacy. In particular, students had low belief in their mathematics learning ability and were highly worried about getting good grades in mathematics. As self-efficacy and anxiety have significant effects on mathematics performance and achievement, findings indicated an unfavourable existing state of mathematics learning among upper secondary students to the nation's aspiration for excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).","Gopal, K.

"In many societies, a girl child is often the one who bears the brunt of unplanned pregnancy. In some instances the pregnancy affects their education, since a decision has to be made on whether or not to continue schooling during and after the pregnancy. This study explored the challenges confronting teenage mothers when they reengaged with secondary school education post-pregnancy in Johannesburg. Qualitative interviews were used to collect data from the teen mothers. Data collected was analyzed using thematic analysis methods. Key findings indicated that some educators were hostile toward the teenage mothers, and treated them differently. This was due to the poor comprehension of applicable policies meant to protect the education interest of pregnant learners and teenage mothers in schools. Recommendations are made for the education authorities to ensure that relevant policies are followed by educators when confronted with learner pregnancy related complication.","Malatji, Hlologelo Dube, Nkosiyazi Nkala-Dlamini, Busisiwe",,"Malatji, H Dube, N Nkala-Dlamini, B",306,"[Malatji, Hlologelo] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Johannesburg, South Africa.

"STEM education is an important approach for preparing students for a competitive workforce with essential skills in the 21st century. However, successfully implementing STEM education in primary and secondary schools presents a variety of challenges. The study suggests that a neglected challenge in the literature is how to sustain teachers' positive emotions toward STEM educational work, which may cause teachers to be more engaged in, motived by, and committed to STEM education. Therefore, the study aims to contribute to the literature by investigating the mechanism of the construction and suitability of teachers' emotions toward STEM educational work based on a single case study conducted in Hong Kong from the social constructionist perspective. The major findings of the study indicate that (1) positive emotions toward STEM educational work may be constructed by the teacher's positive interpretation of the work, i.e., STEM educational work as the facilitator of students' overall development and that (2) positive emotions toward STEM educational work may be sustained by enabling school institutions to have the elements of shared power, administrative support, and the value of a whole-person education.","Lian, Yi Tsang, Kwok-Kuen Zhang, Ying",5769,"Lian, Y Tsang, KK Zhang, Y",,"[Lian, Yi] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.

"Interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) has gained momentum due to increasing calls for a more STEM-literate society. As teaching integrated STEM poses curricular and pedagogical challenges for most generalist primary teachers, professional development (PD) is essential to support them to develop appropriate knowledge and efficacy to teach STEM. This paper presents a qualitative study of 17 primary teachers, 2 school principals and the PD facilitator. It explores the perceived impact of a customised three-phase STEM PD program on teacher efficacy in STEM education using Bandura's (1977) sources of efficacy as an analytic lens. The findings illustrate how particular features of the PD model were identified as contributing to the development of participating teachers' performance accomplishment, emotional arousal, vicarious experiences and verbal persuasion. In particular, there was consensus that the developmental structure of the STEM PD program, in terms of teachers' assuming increasing ownership for their STEM learning, incrementally enhanced teacher efficacy in STEM education. Implications of this study for STEM education and in particular STEM PD are discussed fully.","O'Dwyer, Anne Hourigan, Mairead Leavy, Aisling M.

"With a strong demand for online education and project management in deeper scope and larger scale to better fit COVID-19 pandemic situation, exploring new knowledge of online education to make it more effective became vital with the new challenges of STEM education. To resolve the above problem, this paper focuses on various aspects of online STEM education project management where the Enhanced Noyce Explorers, Scholars, Teachers (E-NEST) three-tiered structure was implemented during the COVID-19 period. Two City University of New York (CUNY) institutions, New York City College of Technology (City Tech) and Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) used the three-tiered structure referred to as Explorer, Scholar and Teacher which incorporated advancements in teaching internships, professional development workshops and mentorships remotely. Built upon the theories of engagement, capacity and continuity (ECC) and team-based learning (TBL), this remote learning model and infrastructure had a positive impact on STEM education and project management. The technological tools utilized included Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft teams, Blackboard Collaborate Ultra, Skype and SurveyMonkey. The results from qualitative and quantitative data including project evaluation, online surveys and focus group interviews demonstrate that the modified remote learning and management tools were effective. This indicated that the E-NEST model greatly supported student success and faculty in online learning and project management meetings.The E-NEST STEM education project was compared to two other project management models along with the previous NEST curriculum. Faculty emphasized practicing project management proactively and utilized best practices of classroom and time management consistent with Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and Project Cycle Management (PCM) guidelines. The comparisons attest that the E-NEST project developed excellent and innovative online platforms for student learning with project management and ECC and TBL applications.Hereafter, this research can be used to constructively develop more online STEM education learning models and platforms and integrate new practice and technology globally.

"This study presents the findings from the analysis of reflections from 26 STEM faculty at various institutions of higher education across the United States who participated in the online course, The Humanity of Inclusive Practices, part of the Teaching and Learning Academy, offered by the John N. Gardner Institute (Gardner Institute) for Excellence in Undergraduate Education. Participants answered three questions at the end of the online course: what are your equity challenges? What are your goals? How do you measure your success?; we analyzed responses using grounded theory. Findings from this study suggest that student-teacher positionality and inequity in prior knowledge may cause equity challenges for educators. Furthermore, the findings suggest that participants in the course set goals such as increasing student success (grades) in the course, empowering students, and incorporating inclusive material in curricula to humanize their course(s). Lastly, the findings reveal that educators measure their success through grades, as well as student engagement and feedback. Recommendations on how to tackle the challenges associated with humanizing STEM course redesign are provided.","Azizi, Mehri Imad, Mays Foote, Stephanie M. M.

"This review study focuses on the works published in academic journals about the impact of COVID-19 on school education. Using the inter-judge analysis technique, 60 articles published in academic journals from different parts of the world were reviewed. It was found that the production of articles includes educational problems that arose mainly in the United States of America, India, and China; it is substantially framed in the areas of Educational Technology, Education Sciences and Health Sciences. It was also observed that the vast majority of publications correspond to opinion articles that place reflection at the higher educational level. Overall, the articles issue educational recommendations for improvement at five levels: public policies in education, care and monitoring of institutions at the higher educational level, care and monitoring of the curriculum, teaching and learning processes, and reconfiguration of the meaning of education.","Nino Carrasco, Shamaly Alheli Castellanos Ramirez, Juan Carlos Huerta Dominguez, Lissete",,"Carrasco, SAN Ramírez, JCC Domínguez, LH",20,"[Nino Carrasco, Shamaly Alheli; Castellanos Ramirez, Juan Carlos] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico.

"Socially and in relation to the individual, schools' mission for STEM education is not limited to the teaching of knowledge and cognitive skills. Although they form an important basis for dealing with today's challenges in a self-confident and responsible manner, they alone are not enough. Positive attitudes towards learning are additional important prerequisites for lifelong learning and participation in society. However, national educational standards still focus mainly on developing cognitive competencies. They hardly take into account multidimensional educational goals that combine both cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. At the classroom level, in everyday school life, addressing both is one of the greatest challenges. Introducing standard-oriented curricula may have the potential to shift teachers' professional perception also to non-cognitive educational goals. We argue that, in order to foster multidimensional educational goals, they need to be more clearly addressed at the policy, teacher training, and teaching level. One important research agenda within STEM education for the next years will be to examine and discuss the connection between the implementation of standard-oriented teaching, the achievement of multiple educational goals, and teachers' professional competence.</p>","Schiepe-Tiska, Anja Heinle, Anna Duemig, Paula Reinhold, Frank Reiss, Kristina",592165,"Schiepe-Tiska, A Heinle, A Duemig, P Reinhold, F Reiss, K",,"[Schiepe-Tiska, Anja; Heinle, Anna; Duemig, Paula; Reiss, Kristina] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Educ, Ctr Int Student Assessment ZIB eV, Munich, Germany.

"To address the urgent challenges of sustainability in our changing world, STEM education must evolve to integrate a stronger focus on socioenvironmental dimensions. This study examines how students in geomatics courses understand the nature of STEM (NoSTEM) in the context of meteorology and fire ecology-fields closely tied to sustainability. Using two validated mixed-method instruments comprising closed- and open-ended items, we assessed students' comprehension across cognitive-epistemic and socio-institutional dimensions, framed within the family resemblance approach (FRA). Data collected from 44 students in meteorology and 57 in fire ecology were analyzed using descriptive statistics and phenomenographic methods. Our findings indicate that, while students demonstrate a stronger grasp of technical concepts, their understanding of socio-institutional implications is comparatively limited. These results highlight the need to align STEM education with sustainability education, emphasizing real-world applications and the integration of socio-institutional elements into the curriculum. Addressing these gaps is essential for preparing students to engage with complex sustainability challenges, such as those posed by climate change, resource management, and disaster mitigation. Future research should investigate long-term interdisciplinary educational strategies to foster a holistic understanding of NoSTEM and its role in promoting sustainable development.","Martinez-Martinez, Victor Ortiz-Revilla, Jairo Brasca Merlin, Almendra Sammaritano, Mariela Molina, Rodrigo Lopez, Matias Greca, Ileana Maria",11208,"Martínez-Martínez, V Ortiz-Revilla, J Merlin, AB Sammaritano, M Molina, R López, M Greca, IM",,"[Martinez-Martinez, Victor; Ortiz-Revilla, Jairo; Greca, Ileana Maria] Univ Burgos, Fac Educ, Burgos 09001, Spain.

"Integrative science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education is heralded as a promising model for effective learning of 21st century STEM literacies and has been suggested as an approach that increases student motivation and engagement. In recent years Ireland has introduced policy with a renewed emphasis on integrated STEM education across all levels of schooling and paying particular attention to the early years and primary settings. The available international literature cites many concerns with potential barriers and failures to achieve authentic integration of the various STEM disciplines in educational contexts. An important determinant of the success of integrated STEM curricula are the backgrounds and attitudes of the individual teachers, as well as supports/experiences in designing and implementing an integrated curricular approach. In the Irish context, this is often in conflict with prescribed overloaded curricula and a subject focussed education system. Therefore, research is required into primary school teachers' perspectives on achieving a truly integrated model of STEM education, particularly in the Irish context. This study employed a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with a sample of practicing teachers (N = 6) to gather perspectives on the potential and challenge of integrating STEM in their respective experiences. These teachers were enrolled in a practice orientated module on STEM education as part of their postgraduate studies. The data gathered was analysed to ascertain these teachers' perspectives on the supports needed to overcome the challenges of integrating STEM subjects within their professional settings. Essentially, the findings of this study will discuss whether such an integrated STEM model is an authentic or utopian ideology.","Delahunty, Thomas Prendergast, Mark Riordain, Maire Ni",666608,"Delahunty, T Prendergast, M Ríordáin, MN",,"[Delahunty, Thomas] Univ Birmingham, Sch Educ, Dept Educ & Social Justice, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.

"The conceptual and generalizing experience of STEM education implementation presented in Ukraine reflects the realization of the sustainable development goals through educational innovations. The study is based on the premise that STEM is a component of education for sustainable development. This educational trend focuses on the goals of Education for All (EFA), conforms to the ideas of the education-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and relates to solving societal challenges in the long run. It is argued that the concept of STEM seeks to offer non-standard solutions to global issues in the field of sustainable development, and STEM education should be seen as a mechanism to accelerate the achievement of all sustainable development goals (SDG) and a strategy to obtain each of them. The specifics of STEM key ideas as global educational trends in the national Ukrainian public space are demonstrated. The consideration of STEM education as a component of the strategy for sustainable development through the detailing of the structure and implementation principles as well as STEM competencies, which are defined as the expected result and key for the person of the XXI century, is proved. The experience of Ukrainian research initiatives in the field of STEM education in the context of sustainable development is summarized. A full-fledged programme complex for comprehensive, equitable and high-quality education is presented, which combines the following links: research and experimental work of different levels, teacher's professional development, museums and science centres work, implementation of various educational programmes, festivals and projects to attract young people to STEM, ensuring equal access for girls and boys.","Buturlina, Oksana Dovhal, Serhii Hryhorov, Heorhii Lysokolenko, Tetiana Palahuta, Vadym",,"Buturlina, O Dovhal, S Hryhorov, H Lysokolenko, T Palahuta, V",323,"[Buturlina, Oksana] Dnipro Acad Continuing Educ, Dnipropetrovsk Reg Council, Dept Informat & Educ Projects Management, Dnipro, Ukraine.

"In the United States, recent STEM education reform initiatives call for teaching STEM subjects through integration of multiple related subjects. In response to this call, an integrated STEM education methods course was developed for secondary preservice teachers in STEM disciplines. At the conclusion of the course, qualitative data (e.g., interviews, student artifacts) were collected to examine the methods course students' practices and experiences of STEM integration. Teachers' learning was approached from situated perspectives that shed light on contexts in which teaching practices are situated and funds of knowledge that individual teachers bring to bear to their teaching contexts. While the students successfully developed STEM integration lessons and taught them, they faced challenges attributable to current school practices, limited interdisciplinary understandings, and a lack of role models. Acknowledging the numerous constraints in the current educational system and structure, several ways were suggested to mitigate the challenges and build on the strengths that preservice teachers established.","Ryu, Minjung Mentzer, Nathan Knobloch, Neil",,"Ryu, M Mentzer, N Knobloch, N",493,"[Ryu, Minjung] Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, 100 N Univ St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.

"Stability of the school education system depends on many factors, and one of the most significant is professionalism of the teaching staff, willingness of the teaching staff to respond to new challenges and effectively carry out professional activities in difficult conditions. The coronavirus pandemic has led to the need to make significant changes in the functioning of the education system as soon as possible, including transfer of the educational process to a remote mode. Despite timely measures taken at the federal and regional levels to ensure continuity of the educational process and preserve a unified educational space, while maintaining the health of all participants in educational relations remained an absolute priority, the school education system faced serious difficulties. The situation was complicated not only by the presence of certain problems in the provision of educational organizations and households with the necessary technical means, but also by the fact that a significant part of the teaching staff did not have practice of teaching remotely and by the beginning of the pandemic were not ready to organize educational process using distance learning technologies. The article presents results of a sociological survey on the readiness of teachers to carry out professional pedagogical activities in the conditions of restrictions caused by the pandemic, based on a comparison of the monitoring data on the eve of the pandemic with the data of 2021.","Semionova, E.

"The experiences and intercultural relationships experienced by native Brazilian peoples inserted in the pedagogical practices of Indigenous School Education (EEI) have strengthened the discussion about the intercultural curriculum as a tactic of resistance, affirmation and empowerment of indigenous protagonism, however, there are still many challenges faced in the construction and application of an indigenous intercultural curriculum in Brazil. This article aims to identify the challenges of construction/application of the intercultural curriculum in the school practices of indigenous teachers, as well as to identify the elements that characterize differentiated, specific and intercultural education in the didactic materials used by teachers in the schools of the Pataxo, Kiriri, Pankarare, Tumbalala indigenous peoples in the state of Bahia, and the Truka, Pankararu and Kapinawa peoples, in Pernambuco. We seek to answer the following questions: a) What are the challenges experienced by teachers during the process of building an intercultural indigenous school curriculum? b) Do the teaching materials used in indigenous schools include content/experiences/experiences that guide a differentiated, specific and intercultural education? The results indicate that, although indigenous peoples are active in the process of building and applying this intercultural curriculum in their schools, it is necessary to implement public policies for its implementation.","Gomes, Katia Maria Andrade, Wbaneide Martins de Santos, Carlos Alberto Batista",,"Gomes, KM Andrade, WMD Santos, CAB",91,"[Gomes, Katia Maria] Univ Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.

"The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to change the way we used to handle education in our homes, through sanitary restrictions that seek to prohibit or reduce physical contact, moving from the traditional way to a virtual methodology; reason for which we must look for new solutions to adapt to this new teaching strategy. In addition, the pandemic has accelerated the arrival of the 4.0 revolution or technological revolution, where new challenges arise for society. The above reasons serve to justify and encourage that STEM education cannot stop. However, given the crisis we are experiencing and the solutions provided, the excessive use of virtual environments can affect areas such as psychological, social, etc. Through this project, a learning model implemented through volunteers is proposed, based on an interactive semi-virtual environment, where the participant can interact synchronously with a volunteering model provided by the volunteer tutor, and the learning process is supported through workshops and the use of virtual tools.","Xie-Li, Danny Jimenez-Valverde, Esteban Arias-Mendez, Esteban",,"Xie-Li, D Jiménez-Valverde, E Arias-Méndez, E",38,"[Xie-Li, Danny; Jimenez-Valverde, Esteban; Arias-Mendez, Esteban] Inst Tecnol Costa Rica, Cartago, Costa Rica.",Instituto Tecnologico de Costa Rica,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; Costa Rica; semi-virtual environment; Covid-19; humanitarian project; STEM workshops; volunteering,10.18845/tm.v34i6.5972,Article,,2215-3241,dxie@ic-itcr.ac.cr; jesjimenez@ic-itcr.ac.cr; esteban.arias@tec.ac.cr,45,,,,XB0XG,,SP,TECNOL MARCHA,Tecnol.

"Health Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve health care, but at the same time, raises many ethical challenges. Within the field of health AI ethics, the solutions to the questions posed by ethical issues such as informed consent, bias, safety, transparency, patient privacy, and allocation are complex and difficult to navigate. The increasing amount of data, market forces, and changing landscape of health care suggest that medical students may be faced with a workplace in which understanding how to safely and effectively interact with health AIs will be essential. Here we argue that there is a need to teach health AI ethics in medical schools. Real events in health AI already pose ethical challenges to the medical community. We discuss key ethical issues requiring medical school education and suggest that case studies based on recent real-life examples are useful tools to teach the ethical issues raised by health AIs.","Katznelson, Gali Gerke, Sara",,"Katznelson, G Gerke, S",1447,"[Katznelson, Gali] Western Univ, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada.

"Internationally, the need to advance science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education is recognized as being vital for meeting social and economic challenges and developing a scientifically, mathematically, and technologically literate citizenry. In many countries, however, there are gender differences in the participation and achievement of girls and women in STEM education and STEM careers, usually to the disadvantage of females. This paper aims to identify challenges to female students' participation in STEM both at post-primary (secondary school) level and beyond in the Irish context. The research questions we aim to address in this paper are: (1) what are student attitudes towards science, technology, engineering and mathematics as measured through interest and perceived ability in STEM, students' valuing of STEM and students' commitment to STEM? and (2) what gender differences occur regarding students' attitudes to science, technology, engineering and mathematics? A survey was completed by 308 post-primary students in Ireland as part of a one-year research project titled ""STEMChAT: Women as catalysts for change in STEM education."" Data analysis compiled descriptive statistics, including response frequencies and percentages and median and interquartile range values, and compared gender differences in survey responses using the Kruskal-Wallis H Test. Results indicated that female students had significantly more positive attitudes to science compared to males while in comparison, males had significantly more positive responses to mathematics compared to females. Challenges regarding access to and understanding of STEM in the context of post-primary education are discussed.","Lane, Ciara Kaya-Capocci, Sila Kelly, Regina O'Connell, Tracey Goos, Merrilyn",959972,"Lane, C Kaya-Capocci, S Kelly, R O'Connell, T Goos, M",,"[Lane, Ciara; O'Connell, Tracey; Goos, Merrilyn] Univ Limerick, Natl Ctr STEM Educ, Sch Educ, EPI STEM, Limerick, Ireland.

"Environmental education has long been recognized as critical for achieving environmental awareness, values and attitudes, skills and behaviour consistent with sustainable development and for effective participation in environmental decision-making. Since the Declaration of the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment concerns about marine pollution and ecotoxicology, among other environmental challenges, should be included in environmental education. However, in the more than forty years since this significant environmental Declaration, marine education has struggled to find a place in the school curriculum of most countries, even though issues such as climate change, chemical contamination of marine environments, coastal eutrophication, and seafood safety continue to threaten human and other species' well-being. This viewpoint discusses how marine education is marginalized in school education, and how marine specialists need to embed school education in their action plans. Particular questions include: who should be educated, about what, where and with what goals in mind?","Gough, Annette",,"Gough, A",633,"[Gough, Annette] RMIT Univ, Sch Educ, POB 71, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia.",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),,"Hong Kong, HONG KONG",8th International Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology (ICMPE),"JUN 20-24, 2016",2025-01-19,Environmental education; Marine education; Sustainability; Curriculum; Marine pollution; Ecotoxicology,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.069,Article; Proceedings Paper,,1879-3363,armette.gough@rmit.edu.au,638,,,,FP9JY,SCIENCE,2,MAR POLLUT BULL,Mar.

"Technology adoption for school education further gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the challenges and strategies of children belonging to the less privileged (we use 'privileged' in the article to identify those enjoying a standard of living or rights as majority of people in the society) families are different from those of the children who come from socio-economically better-off (privileged) backgrounds. The purpose of this research is to explore the experiences of children with school education and using technology for learning. Past studies have highlighted the use of internet and communication technologies as a promising solution to provide quality school education in the remotest parts of the country. Previous research has also ascertained that the socio-economic status divide has no significant impact on the students' ability to learn using technology. Children can use technology to learn irrespective of their socio-economic status and background. We conducted this exploratory qualitative study from a constructivist grounded theory perspective. A purposive sample of 14 students (9 from underprivileged and 5 from privileged family backgrounds) in the age group of 6-14 years, was used and unstructured interviews were conducted. We analysed the data using constructivist grounded theory methodology. We found that the experiences of privileged and underprivileged children differed with respect to access to internet, affordability of ICT device, quality teachers, parental support, and financial sponsorship. However, the experiences and perspectives of the children were found to be similar with respect to personal ownership of mobile phone device for unlimited time at own disposal, self-directed learning and having a trusted study advisor. The findings may be useful to policy makers and EdTech firms to build strategies and solutions for effective implementation of universal school education in the country.","Deepa, V Sujatha, R.

"Increasingly, educational policies and curricula recommend that young children experience STEM learning opportunities within Early Childhood (EC) settings. Despite greater demands placed on EC educators, their opinions on STEM have seldom been sought. This study investigated EC educators' (1) interest in STEM education (2) opinions about the appropriateness of EC STEM education (3) ratings of their STEM self-efficacy and (4) STEM professional development preferences. An anonymous online questionnaire was distributed in the Republic of Ireland, with 198 complete responses received. The respondents, many of whom were highly qualified and experienced educators, reported being interested in STEM and felt it was important, though notably, some believed only for older children. Two-thirds felt their preservice education, which included mathematics (43%); science (30%); technology (17%); and engineering (10%), had not prepared them to support STEM. Knowledge of STEM policy was also limited. Despite this, high levels of STEM confidence were reported. Challenges reported included a lack of resources, support and guidance, and STEM knowledge. 96% of respondents expressed interest in attending EC STEM professional development and a variety of approaches to learning were identified. Implications for policy and practice are suggested.","O'Neill, Sandra Gillic, Cora O'Reilly, Nicola",,"O'Neill, S Gillic, C O'Reilly, N",971,"[O'Neill, Sandra; Gillic, Cora; O'Reilly, Nicola] Dublin City Univ, Inst Educ, St Patricks Campus, Dublin, Ireland.",Dublin City University,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM; early childhood; professional development; early STEM teaching; STEM education,10.1080/03323315.2023.2261903,Article,OCT 2023,1747-4965,cora.gillic@dcu.ie,993,,The authors would like to sincerely thank all those who gave their time so generously to participate in the research.

"The challenges associated with the education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines can be mitigated using didactic videos, but there are other challenges when considering such potential resources. Amautas is a new platform created to facilitate the search and pedagogical integration of good-quality didactic videos, by proposing a set of structured courses while reproducing a YouTube-alike communication style and, therefore, addressing both scopes: STEM education and dissemination. To evaluate Amautas' video-courses use and value for education and dissemination, a quantitative methodology has been followed through a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha =0.906) with 489 participants. Overall findings show that the platform's proposal has achieved a dual use of their didactic videos for education and dissemination purposes (with respective 73% and 82.6% positive responses respectively), and users declare a high positive perception of key metrics and descriptors for adequate content, format, and communicative quality. In fact, 87.9% of participants agree that the contents help them understand topics of interest, and 88.5% agree that the presentation of contents is attractive and interesting. These results show a window of opportunity for further effort investment in the curricular alignment of STEM dissemination resources, fostering their incursion in real classroom scenarios.","Lijo, Ruben Quevedo, Eduardo Castro, Jose Juan",,"Lijo, R Quevedo, E Castro, JJ",157,"[Lijo, Ruben] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria ULPGC, Dept Math, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.

"The implementation of an integrated approach of STEM education with real-life scenarios is crucial to motivate students to learn and to better prepare them for real-world challenges, which is a big challenge for teachers. Therefore, there are implications for teaching practice and consequently the need for professional development. This paper presents an integrated approach of STEM education developed in the context of a collaborative professional development programme implemented in an exclusive online context, provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. The programme aimed at providing teachers with knowledge and skills to develop STEM integrated tasks to be implemented in class. This study used a quantitative-qualitative approach to answer the research questions, using mixed methods to collect data. Participants are primary school teachers who participated in the programme during four months in the school year 2020/2021. Based on data collected from questionnaires, participant observation and teachers' final reports, it was verified that teachers recognized the importance of obtaining training in STEM education and that this type of professional development was very relevant and improved their knowledge and skills to implement STEM hands-on practices in class. In addition, a case study of a science and mathematics 6th grade teacher is presented to illustrate how she implement integrated STEM tasks in class based on a real-world scenario such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, teachers recognized the importance of this approach and that it increases students' motivation to learn.","Costa, Maria Cristina Domingos, Antonio Manuel Dias Teodoro, Vitor Duarte Vinhas, Elia Maria Rodrigues Guedes",3944,"Costa, MC Domingos, AMD Teodoro, VD Vinhas, ÉMRG",,"[Costa, Maria Cristina] Inst Politecn Tomar, Dept Math & Phys, Estrada Serra, P-2300313 Tomar, Portugal.

"The objective of the present study is to investigate the pre-school prospective teachers' level of self efficacy on using the creative drama method and the relationship between several variables and their self efficacy levels. The participants were 190 second, third and fourth year students who attended Department of Pre-School Education during 20082009 and who took the Creative Drama Lesson. The students were given the Self Efficacy Scale Regarding The Use of Creative Drama. Among these students, four students who were chosen by extreme or deviant case sampling were interviewed. The analysis revealed that pre-school prospective teachers' self efficacy on using the creative drama method is in good level and their self-efficacy levels on using the creative drama method differ meaninfully depending on their class, gender and whether they received additional work-shop instruction on the method. The results also revealed differences between the pre-school prospective teachers with high and low self efficacy levels on using the creative drama method.","Cetingoz, Duygu",,"Çetingöz, D",131,"Dokuz Eylul Univ, Buca Egitim Fak, TR-35210 Alsancak, Turkey.",Dokuz Eylul University,,,,,2025-01-19,creative drama method; self-efficacy; pre-school prospective teachers,,Article,,,duygucetingoz@gmail.com,142,,,,980BA,SOCIAL-SKILLS,42,HACET U EGITIM FAK,Hacet.

"This article analyzes STEM projects conducted in eight schools with children from 4 to 10 years old in southern Chile. The main purpose of the study was to describe and analyze how these projects can affect students' and educators' attitudes and create community capacities to tackle local socioecological challenges. We used an ethnographic design with an intentioned coding process of interviews and participant observations to summarize one year of collaborative and transdisciplinary project building. The results describe the main attitudinal changes of teachers and students and give evidence on how these projects create new links and foster collaborations with local actors and organizations that are usually sidelined from educational experiences. Examples of meaningful learning experiences to tackle sustainability challenges were systematized and shared, to inspire new initiatives, raise new voices, and promote active participation of the new generations to foster socioecological resilience.","Bascope, Martin Reiss, Kristina",8414,"Bascopé, M Reiss, K",,"[Bascope, Martin] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr UC Desarrollo Local, Villarrica 4930000, Chile.

"Background People with disabilities face significant healthcare disparities due to barriers to accessing care, negative attitudes of providers, and lack of education on disabilities for healthcare professionals. Physicians report discomfort when interacting with patients with disabilities, adding to the disparity, warranting research on medical school education.Objective Two educational interventions were structured: (1) a brief 2-h intervention in the mandatory curriculum and (2) a 9-week elective course which included interactions with individuals with disabilities through workshops and partner programs. We predicted that both of these interventions would result in improvements in attitude and empathy toward individuals with disabilities and reduce student anxiety.Methods During the 2018-2019 academic year, 54 students completed the surveys for the 2-h intervention and 8 students completed the 2-h intervention and elective course. Pre-, post-, and delayed post-intervention surveys (3 months after post survey) measured students' attitudes, using validated surveys on attitudes, empathy and anxiety toward individuals with disabilities.Results Both educational interventions resulted in improved attitudes toward individuals with disabilities. However, students reported only feeling prepared to care for patients with disabilities after the elective course. The elective course, but not the 2-h course, significantly decreased student anxiety levels, likely due to more individual time working with individuals with disabilities. Delayed analysis after 3 months showed that both interventions had a lasting impact on attitudes and behavior change when caring for individuals with disabilities.Conclusion Medical education is effective at improving medical students' attitudes and behaviors toward individuals with disabilities. A 2-h session can lead to a modest improvement in attitudes. However, more dedicated time and exposure to persons with disabilities results in a greater improvement in students' attitudes, anxiety and preparedness.","Sapp, Richard W.

"Background:& nbsp;Nowadays, in an informational society, digital technologies are present in most areas of life, including school education fields. Students encounter risks or threats during online experiences. Digital resilience helps individuals recognize and manage the risks and threats they come across when they socialize, explore, or work online and plays an important role in the digital technology challenges. However, so far, the concept of digital resilience among individuals in the educational field has not been analyzed in detail.& nbsp;Objectives:& nbsp;The purpose of this study is to clarify the concept of digital resilience among students in a school education context, describe antecedents and consequences, and suggest a conceptual model for health educators.& nbsp;Methods:& nbsp;Walker and Avants' concept analysis method and standards of the scoping review were used to clarify the attributes, antecedents, and consequences from the included articles. A thematic analysis approach of literature was utilized to describe the study findings. No date limitations were applied.& nbsp;Results:& nbsp;A total of 22 included articles provided data for digital resilience conceptualization. Five defining attributes for the concept were identified as follows: (1) understanding online threats; (2) knowing solutions; (3) learning knowledge and skills; (4) recovering from stress; and (5) moving forward through self-efficacy. Antecedents included digital technology-related threats influenced by individual external and internal factors. Consequences were divided into two categories: behavioral performance and psychosocial functioning.& nbsp;Conclusion:& nbsp;Based on the results of the concept analysis, a preliminary conceptual model of digital resilience was described as a circular process toward greater performance and function in the form of understanding, knowing, learning, recovering, and moving forward, when facing stressors, challenges, or adversity. The conceptual model of digital resilience can be further tested and may inform the enhancement of digital-specific resilience measures and interventions for students.","Sun, Haiyan Yuan, Changrong Qian, Qian He, Shuzhi Luo, Qiong",858515,"Sun, HY Yuan, CR Qian, Q He, SZ Luo, Q",,"[Sun, Haiyan; Qian, Qian; He, Shuzhi; Luo, Qiong] Jiangsu Vocat Coll Med, Sch Nursing, Yancheng, Peoples R China.

"Scientific discourses about entrepreneurialism have long been dominated by neo-liberal thinking that categorizes it as gender-neutral. The last two decades however have seen entrepreneurship research develop a more nuanced understanding of gender. Taking the recent findings of entrepreneurial belonging (EB) as dynamic and relational as a starting point, this article aims to better understand how women entrepreneurs are affected by the challenges and chances of defining and negotiating the genderedness of EB. The concept of liminality is used as a critical perspective to gain insights on how women entrepreneurs accomplish entrepreneurial belonging in what is considered a predominantly masculine field like STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics). Insights into explorative interviews question the need for a linear or static ""fixed"" approach of (un)doing gender to foster belonging. More precisely, the data reveal that liminal gender states (LGSs) of EB are linked to the situational perception of dissonance between the subjective ideas of womanhood and a disciplinary as well as entrepreneurial masculine normative frame. And indeed, the data indicate that women STEMpreneurs are continuously triggered by the genderedness of their EB as being a state ""betwixt and between"" normative frames. One the one hand, they feel challenged by the dissonance of LGSs. On the other hand, the interviews also reveal that this challenge turns into an opportunity in situations where LGSs are strategically used to build upon new entrepreneurial routines and roles that foster a state of uniqueness.","Birkner, Stephanie",,"Birkner, S",115,"[Birkner, Stephanie] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlaender Heerstr 138, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,,,,,2025-01-19,Entrepreneurial belonging; Liminality; Gender; STEM; Women entrepreneurs,10.1007/s11365-019-00605-5,Article,OCT 2019,1555-1938,stephanie.birkner@uol.de,136,,Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Germany); European Union; European Social Fund,"The author thanks the anonymous reviewers of the ECSB article development workshop as well as those of the special issue of the International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal for their constructive feedback on the first drafts of this article.

"STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is pivotal in fostering innovation and promoting Germany's position in global industries and in several sectors. This paper explores selected cases of STEM education and STEM related VET in Germany, focusing on how learning outcomes are aligned with the evolving demands of a sustainability-driven economy. By examining ESD educational frameworks, government policies, and industry collaboration, the research explores key competencies developed through STEM curricula, such as green skills, innovative problem-solving, and critical thinking. Despite Germany's progress in STEM education and VET, challenges such as gender disparities, lack of systematic integration of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) into VET curricula, and increasing demand on green talent as well as digitalisation, climate change and increased migration to Germany, present opportunities for further policy refinement on a governance level. Focusing on STEM education in Germany, the paper provides recommendations to better align STEM learning outcomes with labour market needs, emphasising the integration of emerging trends like AI, digitalisation, and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). It also contributes to the better understanding of adult learning and education policy and practice and the international political economy of education policy, both in the context of sustainable development.","Pagkratis, Konstantinos",,"Pagkratis, K",,"[Pagkratis, Konstantinos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Philosophy & Educ, Thessaloniki, Greece.",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM learning outcomes; VET for young adults; ESD; SDG4; green skills,10.1080/02660830.2024.2429886,Article; Early Access,DEC 2024,1478-9833,kpagkrat@edlit.auth.gr,,,,,P4M9B,,,STUD ED ADULTS-NIACE,Stud.

"The global crisis of COVID-19 has exposed a set of challenges in health, economy and education. Although some of the productive activities have been conducted through the rational use of digital technology, the social and formative nature of school education is a particularly complex issue. It requires numerous processes, including a methodological change, based on distance education (DE), the development of institutions and digital infrastructure, consonance with the particular and cultural needs of students and a competitive mastery of the tools available to the faculty. Therefore, this article reflects on the current diagnosis of Peruvian school education, with the purpose of explaining the problem from a systemic perspective and formulating improvements for present and future scenarios.","Marino-Jimenez, Mauro Ramirez-Rodriguez, Lizlaleyne",,"Marino-Jiménez, M Ramírez-Rodríguez, L",150,"[Marino-Jimenez, Mauro] Univ San Ignacio Loyola, La Molina, Peru.

"Featured Application A project using a single board computer offers at a great learning experience, and a good project context for future chemistry teachers to implement in their future teaching careers. Its versatility is also a great challenge that needs addressing. We describe a master's level chemistry education course that was designed to support STEM education by strengthening the E component with an engineering approach. Engineering approach is a method of conducting projects systematically similar to professional engineers. In the course, the future chemistry teachers were given the task of building a measurement instrument using a single-board computer (SBC). In addition to course description, we present a pilot study, the aim of which was to explore the opportunities and challenges the engineering approach initiates with pre-service chemistry teachers trying to accomplish a SBC-based open engineering project. The study employed a qualitative research approach, using the course as the data collection platform. The collected data was analyzed using an inductive content analysis. The data analysis shows that an open SBC project is a good platform for learning and teaching future chemistry teachers about chemistry-driven STEM education, but it is very challenging to conduct. The main conclusion is that the engineering approach is a practical solution for strengthening the engineering in STEM education. To generalize these findings to a wider context, we suggest further research to improve the course using this study's results and re-evaluate the approach in a new instance of the course.","Ambroz, Miha Pernaa, Johannes Haatainen, Outi Aksela, Maija",3278,"Ambroz, M Pernaa, J Haatainen, O Aksela, M",,"[Ambroz, Miha] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Mech Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.

"For over a decade, the National Science Foundation's Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program has funded researchers and educators to build an understanding of best practices, contexts, and processes contributing to K-12 students' motivation and participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) activities that lead to STEM career pathways. The outcomes from these projects have contributed significantly to the national body of knowledge about strategies, successes, models, and interventions that support and encourage youth to pursue STEM careers. While the individual projects discussed in this special issue vary by geographic location, institution, populations served, primary focus, and topic, they are unified by ITEST's programmatic intent and goals. This issue offers research-based insights into the knowledge generated by a decade of ITEST-funded work in STEM career development. The articles describe a multitude of approaches to project design, evaluation, and empirical research. Collectively, they contribute to the development of frameworks for STEM education and workforce development that are increasingly relevant for educators, project designers, researchers, and policy makers. The ITEST program has enabled creativity, experimentation, and cultural responsiveness in STEM education and workforce development and broadened participation in STEM initiatives to Native American communities, underresourced urban communities, girls, and populations underrepresented in STEM fields. By approaching research and evaluation with flexibility and resourcefulness, the authors provide empirical evidence for the value of innovative approaches to STEM education that promote STEM interest and career-related outcomes and that build the foundational skills of the scientific and engineering workforce of the future.","Connors-Kellgren, Alice Parker, Caroline E.

"Challenges related to gender equality are being researched by different institutions, universities, and companies worldwide. In particular, there are still gaps concerning higher education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Through a Rapid Review, this work aims to present the factors that affect women's journey in STEM education in Brazil, mainly in engineering and computer science. More specifically, we seek to describe the barriers, motivators, and strategies present in the researched academic literature. Barriers include stereotypes, oppression, patriarchal relations, prejudice, segregation, isolation, lack of support from colleagues and teachers, judgment, fear of mathematics, and mansplaining - the unnecessary explanation made by a man of something a woman says. Motivators include support from the school and teachers, exposure to the STEM area during high school, teamwork, and support from family, friends, and classmates. The strategies to overcome barriers women face in STEM education include exposure to STEM topics, the inclusion of teachers in encouraging and training, role models, participation in technological competitions, a friendly environment, and women participating in technical evaluators' work. This work presented data revealing women's challenges in STEM, highlighting existing barriers, motivators, and strategies tested to address the low female participation. This information significantly expands the discussion on this topic, especially in the labor market and education. In our view, quality and excellence depend on an inclusive policy where selection is based solely on merit, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or religion.","Costa, Luis Felipe Coimbra Nascimento, Luciana Maria Azevedo De Lima, Yuri Oliveira Santos, Ana Moura Barbosa, Carlos Eduardo Xexeo, Geraldo De Souza, Jano Moreira",,"Costa, LFC Nascimento, LMA De Lima, YO Santos, AM Barbosa, CE Xexéo, G De Souza, JM",112576,"[Costa, Luis Felipe Coimbra; Nascimento, Luciana Maria Azevedo; De Lima, Yuri Oliveira; Barbosa, Carlos Eduardo; Xexeo, Geraldo; De Souza, Jano Moreira] Univ Fed Rio De Janeiro, Program Syst & Comp Engn, BR-21941450 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.

"This article presents a critical analysis of the challenges and limitations of didactic approaches and educational research developed within the STEM movement. It is argued that most practices and studies labeled as STEM are of deficient educational quality and are scarcely new compared to existing science, technology and mathematics education approaches. The viability of STEM for the Spanish education system is likewise questioned, and the overuse of the acronym, often coined as a slogan to raise funding or to advertise long-established educational initiatives and materials rebranded as STEM, is discussed. Finally, the need for a rigorous didactic validation process to guide the potentials and limitations of STEM education is considered.","Bogdan Toma, Radu Garcia-Carmona, Antonio",,"Toma, RB García-Carmona, A",65,"[Bogdan Toma, Radu] Univ Burgos, Dept Didact Especif, Burgos, Spain.

"This paper focuses on the notable heightening of underrepresented students' engagement in STEM education through project-based learning CincySTEM iTEST projects. The projects, funded by an iTEST NSF grant, were designed and facilitated by teachers at a new STEM urban public high school serving low-income African-American students. Student engagement conceptualized as a psychological process involving affective and behavioral participation in classroom activities was evaluated through a mixed-methods approach. Findings indicate that affective and behavioral participation was significantly enhanced when project activities utilized digital devices in hands-on investigations of real-world project activities. Explanations for the success of CincySTEM iTEST projects are presented in the conclusion along with challenges for sustainability.","Beckett, Gulbahar H.

"China has made remarkable progress along the path of economic transformation over the past three decades. To continue its rapid growth in an economy with increasingly higher wages, China's key challenge is whether it can become competitive enough in quasi-skilled and skilled sectors so that more technologically advanced industries and service sector firms eventually take the place of exiting low-wage factories. This study seeks to increase our understanding of high school education in China at a time when the nation is facing challenges in its development path. Using secondary statistics, we have found that educational access at the high school level is quite low, especially in poorer areas of rural China. We argue that the low level of access to high school education in China may be a problem resulting from high tuition and fees. We include empirical evidence about the tuition barrier argument by using a survey of 41 developing and developed countries and a representative survey of 1177 students from one of China's poorest provinces. We demonstrate that not only is financing high school a burden for the families of poor students, but there is also little financial aid available. The quality of education of students from poor rural areas prior to entering high school is also a problem. We conclude with a recommendation that in poor rural areas of China high school should be made free, as it is in most of the rest of the world, and efforts should be made to improve rural education in general.","Liu, Chengfang Zhang, Linxiu Luo, Renfu Rozelle, Scott Sharbono, Brian Shi, Yaojiang",PII 917830894,"Liu, CF Zhang, LX Luo, RF Rozelle, S Sharbono, B Shi, Y",503,"[Liu, Chengfang; Zhang, Linxiu; Luo, Renfu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"Gender equality is a concept that is synonymous with debates towards economic and societal advancement, as manifested through the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 5. This study sets out to identify the key indicators driving gender equality in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and employment in Jordan. This area is both critical and timely in light of emerging challenges facing technological advancement, progressive economies, and wider societal inclusion strategies within the professional environment. This study predominantly employs a quantitative methodology, utilising a survey to evaluate and rank a comprehensive set of indicators/challenges associated with gender equality in the published literature. Feedback is gathered from both male and female participants. The findings of this study reveal certain categories and indicators that are highly ranked compared with others, with practical aspects such as workplace conditions and professional treatment, societal norms and gender stereotypes, and professional perceptions and underlying gender bias being more predominant in Jordan. This study also revealed differing challenges facing gender equality in employment compared with the ones faced in education. This finding resonates with the historical trajectory of academic progress in STEM fields in Jordan, and its divergence emphasises the need for a nuanced exploration to advance gender equality in STEM effectively.","Sharif, Ahlam A.

"The Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE) is a non-profit educational organization committed to promoting the transformation of undergraduate STEM education by supporting departments in removing barriers to access, equity, and inclusion and in adopting evidence-based teaching and learning practices. The PULSE Ambassadors Campus Workshop program enables faculty and staff members of host departments to 1) develop communication, shared leadership, and inclusion skills for effective team learning; 2) implement facilitative leadership skills (e.g., empathic listening and collaboration); 3) create a shared vision and departmental action plan; and 4) integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion practices in the department and curriculum. From the first workshop in 2014, teams of trained Ambassadors conducted workshops at 58 institutions, including associate, bachelor, master, and doctoral institutions. In their workshop requests, departments cited several motivations: desire to revise and align their curriculum with Vision and Change recommendations, need for assistance with ongoing curricular reform, and wish for external assistance with planning processes and communication. Formative assessments during and immediately following workshops indicated that key outcomes were met. Post-workshop interviews of four departments confirm progress achieved on action items and development of individual department members as agents of change. The PULSE Ambassadors program continues to engage departments to improve undergraduate STEM education and prepare departments for the challenges and uncertainties of the changing higher education landscape.","Fink, Alix D.

"The purpose of this paper is to explore teachers' awareness, experiences, and perceptions regarding the environmental impact of digitalization in school education across five European countries. Using an existential phenomenological approach, the study uncovers the lived experiences of 29 teachers, who participated in group semi-structured interviews. The findings highlight that teachers share a strong awareness of contemporary environmental challenges, such as climate change and pollution, and that environmental education is integrated into most school curricula, especially topics like recycling, composting, and pollution. Teachers express a genuine concern for educating students about global warming and its consequences, recognizing that today's students will shape the future. Despite acknowledging the benefits of technology in education, teachers are not fully informed about the environmental impact of digitalization. The paper reveals teachers' concerns about the energy consumption, carbon emissions, and electronic waste associated with digital technologies. Teachers propose strategies to address the environmental impact of digitalization, including prolonging device lifespans, responsible e-waste recycling, and promoting energy-efficient practices. They emphasize the need for proper teacher training in incorporating digitalization's environmental impact into the curriculum. The study underscores the importance of engaging students through research activities, discussions, multimedia resources, and hands-on experiences to raise awareness about digitalization's ecological footprint. Implications of a more informed and proactive approach to addressing the ecological footprint of digital technologies in school education are discussed.","Vlachopoulos, Dimitrios Thorkelsdottir, Rannveig Bjoerk Schina, Despoina Jonsdottir, Jona Guorun",13353,"Vlachopoulos, D Thorkelsdóttir, RB Schina, D Jónsdóttir, JG",,"[Vlachopoulos, Dimitrios] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.

"Women are underrepresented in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths); with further stratification existing for those from low socio-economic backgrounds. Understanding the reasons for this is essential to progress towards equality in STEM fields. This paper takes the perspective of such marginalized groups and explores their beliefs about STEM within a school-based system, for the purposes of this study a focus has been placed on gender and socio-economic status. Focus groups were conducted with 18 female participants attending Irish secondary schools. The results provide insight into the challenges faced when pursuing STEM; additionally, the motivating and inhibiting factors are reported. Results reveal how social and academic barriers prevent young women from progressing in STEM, highlighting how intersectional layers of disadvantage limit equal access in STEM education. Such findings can inform the development of policies to help students access STEM-education, especially those attending schools characterized by higher concentrations of students from low-socio-economic backgrounds.","Boyle, Neasa McGettrick, Rachel O'Sullivan, Katriona",2387082,"Boyle, N McGettrick, R O'Sullivan, K",,"[Boyle, Neasa; McGettrick, Rachel; O'Sullivan, Katriona] Maynooth Univ, Dept Psychol, Kildare, Ireland.",Maynooth University,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM; gender; socio-economic status; DEIS (delivering equality of opportunity in schools),10.1080/02673843.2024.2387082,Article,,2164-4527,neasa.boyle.2019@mumail.ie,,,Science Foundation Ireland [20/DP/8109],This publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland [grant number 20/DP/8109].,A9X2R,SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; SCHOOL-STUDENTS; ROLE-MODEL; GENDER; SCIENCE; MOTIVATION; WOMEN; YOUNG; PARTICIPATION,1,INT J ADOLESC YOUTH,Int.

"The purpose of this article is to analyze how Law n degrees 10.639 (Brasil, 2003) contributes to inclusive education, especiallyquilombola school education. As a research methodology, documentary analysis of the Law and regulations that dealwith implementation was used. The theoretical support used to support the analysis were authors such as Quijano (2005), Gomes (2005, 2012), among others who contributed to the understanding of the scenario of education for ethnic-racial relations and quilombola school education, its principles and challenges , as well as to understand the importance of including in the school curriculum what Law n degrees 10.639 (Brasil, 2003) proposes, so that discussions about the history and culture of the African and Afro-Brazilian population are part of everyday school life, aiming to combat racism and the appreciation of brazilian ethnic-racial diversity. The study showed that the struggle, mainly by the Black Movement, has generated results with regard to the implementation of public policies aimed at the education of the black/quilombola population, such as the historic milestone- the creation of Law n degrees 10,639 (Brasil, 2003). However, there is a lot to be done, especially when it comes to a scenario that facilitates the implementation of the Law and the decolonization of the curriculum, as barriers, such as the lack of teacher training, for example, are still a reality to be overcome.","Oliveira, Gilma Souza Cardozo, Leriane Silva dos Santos, Jose Francisco",e45354,"Oliveira, GS Cardozo, LS dos Santos, JF",,"[Oliveira, Gilma Souza; Cardozo, Leriane Silva; dos Santos, Jose Francisco] Univ Fed Oeste Bahia UFOB, Barreiras, BA, Brazil.

"Disability is an important and often overlooked component of diversity. Individuals with disabilities bring a rare perspective to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) because of their unique experiences approaching complex issues related to health and disability, navigating the healthcare system, creatively solving problems unfamiliar to many individuals without disabilities, managing time and resources that are limited by physical or mental constraints, and advocating for themselves and others in the disabled community. Yet, individuals with disabilities are underrepresented in STEMM. Professional organizations can address this underrepresentation by recruiting individuals with disabilities for leadership opportunities, easing financial burdens, providing equal access, fostering peer-mentor groups, and establishing a culture of equity and inclusion spanning all facets of diversity. We are a group of deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) engineers, scientists, and clinicians, most of whom are active in clinical practice and/or auditory research. We have worked within our professional societies to improve access and inclusion for D/HH individuals and others with disabilities. We describe how different models of disability inform our understanding of disability as a form of diversity. We address heterogeneity within disabled communities, including intersectionality between disability and other forms of diversity. We highlight how the Association for Research in Otolaryngology has supported our efforts to reduce ableism and promote access and inclusion for D/HH individuals. We also discuss future directions and challenges. The tools and approaches discussed here can be applied by other professional organizations to include individuals with all forms of diversity in STEMM.</p>","Huyck, Julia Jones Anbuhl, Kelsey L.

"Science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields change rapidly and are increasingly interdisciplinary. Commonly, STEMM practitioners use short-format training (SFT) such as workshops and short courses for upskilling and reskilling, but unaddressed challenges limit SFT's effectiveness and inclusiveness. Education researchers, students in SFT courses, and organizations have called for research and strategies that can strengthen SFT in terms of effectiveness, inclusiveness, and accessibility across multiple dimensions. This paper describes the project that resulted in a consensus set of 14 actionable recommendations to systematically strengthen SFT. A diverse international group of 30 experts in education, accessibility, and life sciences came together from 10 countries to develop recommendations that can help strengthen SFT globally. Participants, including representation from some of the largest life science training programs globally, assembled findings in the educational sciences and encompassed the experiences of several of the largest life science SFT programs. The 14 recommendations were derived through a Delphi method, where consensus was achieved in real time as the group completed a series of meetings and tasks designed to elicit specific recommendations. Recommendations cover the breadth of SFT contexts and stakeholder groups and include actions for instructors (e.g., make equity and inclusion an ethical obligation), programs (e.g., centralize infrastructure for assessment and evaluation), as well as organizations and funders (e.g., professionalize training SFT instructors; deploy SFT to counter inequity). Recommendations are aligned with a purpose-built framework-""The Bicycle Principles""-that prioritizes evidenced-based teaching, inclusiveness, and equity, as well as the ability to scale, share, and sustain SFT. We also describe how the Bicycle Principles and recommendations are consistent with educational change theories and can overcome systemic barriers to delivering consistently effective, inclusive, and career-spanning SFT.","Williams, Jason J.

"PurposeThis research seeks to explore the potential of Lesson Study as a vehicle to support professional development (PD) in a rural, Irish primary school. Lesson Study was utilised to design and implement integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) lessons with young children (ages 4-7 years).Design/methodology/approachThree teachers were introduced to and participated in four cycles of Lesson Study over the course of one school year. Qualitative data were generated from interviews, collaborative weekly meetings and observation sheets.FindingsAnalysis suggests that Lesson Study supported the development of a culture of collaboration and provided an opportunity for teachers to share their knowledge. Findings also reveal that Lesson Study motivated teachers to reflect on their role within the classroom and enabled them to move away from teacher-led approaches. Although teachers perceived Lesson Study to be a beneficial form of PD, factors constrained their engagement, including practical, cultural and sustainability challenges.Practical implicationsThe study explores the adaptability of Lesson Study in first level education in the context of STEM education. It reveals teachers' first experience of Lesson Study, given its stark contrast to more ""traditional"" PD experiences they are accustomed to. This article will, therefore, be of interest to teachers, school leaders and policy makers.Originality/valueThis paper contributes initial findings to a currently under-researched area, Lesson Study in a rural context. This study also combines Lesson Study with STEM education, which has not been widely explored.","Flanagan, Bridget Hourigan, Mairead Leavy, Aisling",,"Flanagan, B Hourigan, M Leavy, A",57,"[Flanagan, Bridget] Marino Inst Educ, Dublin, Ireland.

"Interventional radiology and cardiology are rapidly growing areas of minimally invasive surgery, covering multiple diagnostic and interventional procedures. Treatment via endovascular techniques has become the go-to approach, thanks to its minimally invasive nature and its effectiveness in reducing hospitalisation and total time to recovery when compared to open surgery. Although x-ray fluoroscopy is currently the gold standard imaging technique for endovascular interventions, it presents occupational safety hazards to medical personnel and potential risks to patients, especially paediatric patients, because of its inherent ionising radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its unique ability to provide radiation-free imaging, and acquiring morphologic and functional information, holds great promise in the advancement of image-guided navigation through the vasculature. Moreover, MRI has the potential to combine diagnosis, therapy and early evaluation of therapy in the same intervention. However, MR-guided interventions face a major challenge due to the presence of a large magnetic field (1.5/3 Tesla), which limits the set of materials suitable for the construction of key instrumentation (sheaths, catheters and guidewires). Despite these challenges, in recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of interventional devices, which comprise biocompatible, MR safe and MR visible materials. In an attempt to encourage and accelerate the development of MR-guided endovascular instrumentation, we present a systematic and illustrated overview of the plethora of work targeting to overcome the aforementioned limitations which are underpinned by the interdependent advancements in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM).","Abdelaziz, Mohamed E.

"Due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, mobile technologies, services, and Internet connectivity have become critical among the Malaysian elderly as an alternative to staying actively and socially connected. However, the elderly find it difficult to adapt to online technology tools with restricted skills under technology challenges. Studies related to mobile adoption and usage experiences among the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic or endemic are not rigorously conducted by researchers. Little discussion was focused specifically on aging and gender perspectives, including the importance of an intersectionality lens in understanding the interconnected factors that influence one's ability to benefit from technology. To fill in the research gaps, this paper aims to use an intersectionality lens to identify experiences on how female elderly use their mobile phones and services, as women are constantly underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) studies. The study employed qualitative case studies method with seven older women in Malaysia, 60 to 77 years old, using multiple data sources through semi-structured interviews, mobile walkthrough, and diary studies. Data were transcribed and analyzed by categorizing the key themes digitally using Nvivo. The findings showed that mobile culture and supportive environment; family roles; socialization; education and economic backgrounds; digital literacy level; well-being; and motivation were interconnected, shaping the experiences of the seven female elderly in accessing, learning, and using their mobile phones. This study has built an understanding of the intersecting factors that can contribute to a more inclusive society, especially in promoting the elderly to embrace mobile technologies in their lives.","Tan, Jia Yue Koo, Ah Choo Wong, Chui Yin Lai, Wan Teng",,"Tan, JY Koo, AC Wong, CY Lai, WT",1282,"[Tan, Jia Yue; Koo, Ah Choo] Multimedia Univ, Fac Creat Multimedia, Cyberjaya 63100, Selangor, Malaysia.

"The aim of this study is to explore how academic teachers view and experience challenges in teaching communication. During a teacher training course 92 STEM teachers developed, implemented, evaluated and reported on altogether 44 authentic communication elements. Content analysis was used for analysing teachers' written answers to questions before the course, and reports after the course. The results illustrate teachers' move towards a 'communicating-to-learn' approach, and their increased capacity to articulate and overcome challenges. A major conclusion is that a teacher training course facilitating curriculum-wide implementation of authentic communication elements offers an effective way of academic development.","Pelger, Susanne",,"Pelger, S",17,"[Pelger, Susanne] Lund Univ, Fac Sci, Lund, Sweden.",Lund University,,,,,2025-01-19,Academic development; communication skills; curriculum development; higher education; STEM education,10.1080/1360144X.2021.1891905,Article,APR 2021,1470-1324,susanne.pelger@science.lu.se,30,,,,0T6HM,,1,INT J ACAD DEV,Int.

"The COVID-19 outbreak has caused disarray in the country's formal school education system (Ministry of Education in Initiatives by School Education Sector in 2020-21 for Continuing Teaching and Learning. https://dsel.education.gov.in/sites/default/files/update/covid_initiatives.pdf, 2021). While some children had engaged in learning from home using digital devices, television, radio and also with the guidance of volunteers and peers, dropouts and out of school children have become a major concern as a result of school closures, with other areas of concern also including teaching and learning for children with no access to digital gadgets, continuing learning for children with special needs, teacher's reach/unavailability, access to engaging learning material, internet connectivity, etc., and in this frame of reference, digital divide-free online and blended learning has become a much-needed demand of the hour. Addressing these challenges for a diverse nation, however, necessitates an effective policy and implementation framework to ensure its reach at the grassroots level while accepting the challenges of operationalization. This paper discusses the challenges of effective digital learning and recommendations for overcoming the barriers of Online and Blended Learning, with a focus on how technology would then take over and shoot through the roof of learning in the future.","Kumar, Rajnish Ganesh, R.

"The ""Indigenous Knowledge Action Project at the School - UFMT Network"" is a political action aimed at indigenous school education in order to meet the specific rights of the people from Brazil. In Mato Grosso, it focuses on the continuing education of 115 teachers from 12 indigenous peoples, with a focus on literacy, literacy and numeracy, as well as the production of bilingual teaching material. Respect for their own learning processes, language and culture from an intercultural perspective is a right, and this paper examines this right within the context of the production of teaching materials with three peoples. The collaborative research referenced the indigenous pedagogies contained within the teaching material and the sociolinguistic policy that permeates the historical struggles of the original peoples. The data analysis emphasizes the complexity of political action aimed at school education that considers intercultural knowledge and practices and enables people to build their identities and worldviews as they also become literate in the world. It is concluded that strategies of solidary learning networks help indigenous communities face challenges and political obstacles, such as the withdrawal of rights and specific public policies that directly impact the indigenous peoples of Brazil.","de Alcantara Ferreira, Waldineia Antunes Zoia, Alceu Grando, Beleni Salete",,"Ferreira, WAD Zoia, A Grando, BS",,"[de Alcantara Ferreira, Waldineia Antunes] Univ Estado Mato Grosso UNEMAT, Programa Posgrad Educ PPGEdu UNEMAT, Curso Pedag Intercultural FAINDI UNEMAT, Caceres, Mato Grosso, Brazil.

"Background Transforming the culture of STEM higher education to be more inclusive and help more students reach STEM careers is challenging. Herein, we describe a new model for STEM higher education transformation, the Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM, (STEM)(2), ""STEM-squared"", Network. The Network embraces a pathways model, as opposed to a pipeline model, to STEM career entry. It is founded upon three strong theoretical frameworks: Communities of Transformation, systems design for organizational change, and emergent outcomes for the diffusion of innovations in STEM education. Currently composed of five institutions-three private 4-year universities and two public community colleges-the Network capitalizes on the close geographic proximity and shared student demographics to effect change across the classroom, disciplinary, institutional, and inter-institutional levels. Results The (STEM)(2) Network has increased the extent to which participants feel empowered to be change agents for STEM higher education reform and has increased collaboration across disciplines and institutions. Participants were motivated to join the Network to improve STEM education, to improve the transfer student experience, to collaborate with colleagues across disciplines and institutions, and because they respected the leadership team. Participants continue to engage in the Network because of the collaborations created, opportunities for professional growth, opportunities to improve STEM education, and a sense that the Network is functioning as intended. Conclusion The goal to increase the number and diversity of people entering STEM careers is predicated on transforming the STEM higher education system to embrace a pathways model to a STEM career. The (STEM)(2) Network is achieving this by empowering faculty to transform the system from the inside. While the systemic transformation of STEM higher education is challenging, the (STEM)(2) Network directly addresses those challenges by bridging disciplinary and institutional silos and leveraging the reward structure of the current system to support faculty as they work to transform this very system.","Santangelo, Jessica Hobbie, Lawrence Lee, Jacqueline Pullin, Michael Villa-Cuesta, Eugenia Hyslop, Alison",3,"Santangelo, J Hobbie, L Lee, J Pullin, M Villa-Cuesta, E Hyslop, A",,"[Santangelo, Jessica] Hofstra Univ, 1000 Hempstead Turnpike, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA.

"In recent years, there have been unprecedented changes in technologies driven by automation, robotics and artificial intelligence, the fusion of which is referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (I-4) with a potential to change the future of work. One of the worldwide concerns is on the employment effects of I-4. There are two scenarios-one called as ""automation anxiety"" that focuses on labour substitution effects and the other which is ""optimistic"" of technological complementarity of creating new jobs. Either way, what is certain is that the nature of the future of work will not be the same as it is in the present, and the future workforce needs agile capabilities. The preparation for such a challenge begins with the foundational school education. This paper, after a brief overview of the debate on the impact of I-4 on employment, turns to the issue of the preparedness in India in terms of the foundational education at the school level. Based on the evidence, it documents the deep learning crisis in school education in India and argues for strengthening foundation-level school education through an increase in public investment and public provision that would ensure better capabilities in an equitable way.","Reddy, Narasimha D.",,"Reddy, ND",199,"[Reddy, Narasimha D.] Univ Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India.",University of Hyderabad,,,,,2025-01-19,Future of work; Industry 4; Automation anxiety; Capabilities; Learning crisis; Learning achievement,10.1007/s41027-020-00227-4,Article,,0019-5308,duvvurunarasimha@gmail.com,224,,,,UA9ZO,,2,INDIAN J LABOUR ECON,Indian J.

"In recent years shifts in education policy in Australia have generated new governance arrangements which have increased the material and affective labour of parents associated with school education. However, affective labour undertaken by parents is often understood as a private concern and an issue of personal choice. This article challenges this view by examining the labour of parents in connection with the aims of public policy in school education. By employing the concept of affective governmentality to connect governing strategies with citizen experience, the article explores the connection between the emotional labour of parents' and policy aims in school education policy. Based on interviews and qualitative questionnaires with parents of school-aged children in Australia, the study uses an interpretive lens to unpack the role of emotional labour. The study reveals the dual role of parents, mostly mothers who serve both as recipients and active agents in public policy. The research shows that emotional responses and gendered labour are interconnected - depicting them as dynamic forces that both motivate and mobilise support for policy objectives. This research contributes to our understanding of the interplay between emotions, policy dynamics and gendered labour and has implications for our understanding of what constitutes a 'policy actor'.","Warner, Sarah Adele",,"Warner, SA",,"[Warner, Sarah Adele] Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.

"The use of geographical information systems (GIS) is attracting growing global enthusiasm among scholars and in the scientific world. Due to the significance of GIS and the increased demand for its use, its application in secondary school education has also become very important at both national and international levels. This paper reviews the current state of GIS application in southern African secondary schools. Although GIS is included in the education curriculum in several African countries, some countries still trail behind. Furthermore, despite the fact that good progress has been made with GIS education, many learning institutions in Africa still face challenges regarding its development and application as a teaching and learning tool. The main problems identified in this review include the absence of GIS education in secondary school curricula; the shortage of experienced teachers; the lack of knowledge and technical expertise; the unwillingness of teachers to change their mode of teaching; a shortage of funds, and inadequate resources.

"With the promotion of STEM education and active practice, experiential learning has become a crucial instructional design strategy. Experiential learning emphasizes a student-centered learning model, encouraging students to explore unknown fields through individual and team collaborative efforts. Through practical activities, it promotes active exploration and deep understanding, thereby stimulating students' creativity and independent thinking abilities. However, there are still some challenges confronting the learners. However, due to the limitations of short-term memory and the ability to organize key information, students often struggle to recall all past dialogues during reflection and observation processes. This hinders effective discussions and communication, impacting the application of collaborative strategies. To address this challenge in STEM collaborative discussions, this study explores the application of generative AI technology in STEM education. By integrating experiential learning with collaborative strategies, the goal is to enhance students' learning outcomes and reflective thinking. This research introduces a GPT-based large language model tool, the GPT-Assisted Summarization Aid (GASA), which is applied in collaborative learning activities within the framework of experiential learning. GASA supports learners in their reflective observation and conceptualization processes by providing feedback and assistance tailored to different phases of the experiential learning curriculum. The experimental results indicate significant differences in learning outcomes and reflective thinking between the experimental group using GASA and the control group. Furthermore, students in the experimental group were more effective in sharing information, establishing a common understanding, and solving problems during the collaborative learning process. This study provides empirical evidence for teaching strategies in STEM education and reveals the potential of generative AI technology in educational technology. Future research should explore larger sample sizes and long-term learning impacts to further validate the broad applicability of GASA in different educational contexts.","Lin, Chia-Ju Lee, Hsin-Yu Wang, Wei-Sheng Huang, Yueh-Min Wu, Ting-Ting",,"Lin, CJ Lee, HY Wang, WS Huang, YM Wu, TT",,"[Lin, Chia-Ju; Lee, Hsin-Yu; Wang, Wei-Sheng; Huang, Yueh-Min] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, 1,Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.

"This paper focuses on challenges experienced by 'teacher-FS leaders' implementing Forest School within the neoliberal and risk-averse culture of UK primary school education. Thematic analysis of interviews with 12 'teacher-FS leaders' identified five key themes: embedding Forest School within the curriculum is a long-term process; negotiating the performative culture and curriculum constraints; professional identities, values, and pedagogies; negotiating risk aversion; budget and time constraints. Teacher-FS leaders adapted FS principles to meet the needs of their primary school setting. However, they found ways of overcoming challenges, and sought to persuade others of the value of Forest School and outdoor learning.","Whincup, Victoria A. Allin, Linda J. Greer, Joanna M.

"This article focuses on a project carried out by the IEEE Computer Society Student Chapter at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology. The project was aimed to encourage the participation of underprivileged groups in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) careers through workshops and educational activities. It was conducted in four schools with low economic growth, with a focus on the participation of women in the activities. The project successfully brought STEM education closer to these groups, providing them with opportunities and tools to explore these areas. The results obtained during the workshops reflected increased interest and understanding among the students regarding STEM career options. The article highlights the importance of this project in the context of Latin American countries, where the growth of STEM careers has been slow due to prejudices and sociocultural problems. Topics addressed in the article include the objectives, significance, and results of the activity, the definition of underprivileged groups, the challenges these groups face in choosing STEM careers, as well as the associated statistics. The article also includes post-project observations from the perspective of students, teachers, and volunteers, providing a more comprehensive view of the impacts and challenges faced.","Guevara-Rosello, Ana Maria Retana-Ledezma, Jostin Joel",,"Guevara-Roselló, AM Retana-Ledezma, JJ",126,"[Guevara-Rosello, Ana Maria; Retana-Ledezma, Jostin Joel] Inst Tecnol Costa Rica, Cartago, Costa Rica.",Instituto Tecnologico de Costa Rica,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; educational experiences; disadvantaged groups; sociocultural challenges; social impact; equal opportunities,10.18845/tm.v37i5.7226,Article,,2215-3241,agb@ieee.org; jostinretana@ieee.org,134,,,,J1M4X,,,TECNOL MARCHA,Tecnol.

"To promote computational thinking in mathematics education, Scratch is used to foster students' computational thinking and mathematical understanding. However, students face challenges in block-based programming environments, such as having low motivation, high anxiety, and cognitive loads. This study combined the pedagogical values of Geogebra and Scratch to enhance primary students' learning outcomes in computational thinking. We investigated two interventions (solely Scratch and Scratch combined with Geogebra) among 72 Hong Kong fifth-grade students. We found that students who learned computational thinking using Scratch and Geogebra had higher motivation, perceived ability, and lower cognitive load than those who only used Scratch. However, students' anxiety had no significant difference between the two groups. In addition, Students faced more challenges and gained less positive learning outcomes in Scratch group. The use of Geogebra can better complement Scratch in teaching computational thinking in primary mathematics classrooms. We identified the potential of using Geogebra to visualize mathematical knowledge and help students apply what they have learned in block-based languages. Pedagogical implications are provided for instructional design and teaching strategies of computational thinking integrated with STEM education.","Fang, Xiaoxuan Ng, Davy Tsz Kit Yuen, Manwai",,"Fang, XX Ng, DTK Yuen, MW",,"[Fang, Xiaoxuan] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

"In this paper we argue that the complexity of education systems can lead to a lack of coherence in the implementation of policy. More effective educational change requires policy -makers and researchers to pay more attention to supporting teachers in classrooms. As an example, we consider decades of research attempts in STEM education to implement learning through inquiry and note there has been little change in teaching practices in classrooms. Using formative assessment in science education as a case study, we developed a rubric for teachers that embeds key aspects of the desired pedagogy. We argue this builds teachers' confidence to implement the change in their classrooms and we claim this same principle may apply to the development of rubrics for in other disciplines, and easily incorporated by researchers into professional learning programs.","Cirkony, Connie Kenny, John Daniel",,"Cirkony, C Kenny, JD",77,"[Cirkony, Connie; Kenny, John Daniel] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",University of Tasmania,,,,,2025-01-19,teacher change; assessment; representational competence; teacher support; education policy,,Article,,,,105,,Australian Research Council as part of the Digital Pedagogies project [LP130100233]; Australian Research Council [LP130100233] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Acknowledgements This research associated with Cirkony (2019) was supported by the Australian Research Council as part of the Digital Pedagogies project (LP130100233) .,E4BN2,PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; STEM EDUCATION; PERSPECTIVES; CHALLENGES,10,AUST J TEACH EDUC,Aust.

"Significant resources have been invested by multiple entities and institutions into exposing more students and adults to science, technology, education, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers. These efforts have coalesced into a major educational and career development movement within the past few decades. In this article, we present a critical analysis of the STEM movement that seeks to inform dialogue and debate regarding the nature and potential impacts of STEM career development. The article identifies the inherent assumptions about equity, self-determination, meaning, and purpose that underlie the STEM movement, while also acknowledging its many important positive contributions. The potential unintended consequences of STEM interventions and programs as well as the social messaging that accompanies these efforts are reviewed. Future directions for research, practice, and public policy that are informed by this critical analysis conclude this article.","Blustein, David L.

"This study examined the mediation effect of practical training on the relationship of demographic characteristics with bystander self-efficacy in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performance. We used nationwide, cross-sectional data from the Korea Community Health Survey and analyzed 25,082 Korean adults who participated in CPR training within the last 2 years. A mediation model was applied to explore the pathway from demographic characteristics via CPR practical training to self-efficacy in CPR performance. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine each path in the mediation model. Of the 25,082 respondents recently trained, 19,168 (76.8%) practiced on a manikin. In the unadjusted CPR practical training model, the demographic characteristics associated with high self-efficacy in CPR performance were male gender (odds ratio [OR] = 2.54); 50s age group (OR = 1.30); college or more (OR = 1.39) and high school education (OR = 1.32); white collar (OR = 1.24) and soldier (OR = 2.98) occupational statuses. The characteristics associated with low self-efficacy were 30s age group (OR = 0.69) and capital (OR = 0.79) and metropolitan (OR = 0.84) areas of residence (p < 0.05). In the adjusted CPR practical training model, the significance of the relationship between demographics and self-efficacy in CPR performance decreased in male gender, 30s age group, college or more and high school education, and soldier occupational status (i.e., partial mediation), and disappeared in metropolitan residents (i.e., complete mediation). The degree of the mediating effect of CPR practical training on self-efficacy differed for each demographic characteristic. Thus, individualized educational strategies considering recipient demographics are needed for effective practice-based CPR training and improving bystander CPR performance.","Yoon, Wonjeong Ro, Young Sun Cho, Sung-il",e0215432,"Yoon, W Ro, YS Cho, SI",,"[Yoon, Wonjeong] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Seoul, South Korea.

"STEM education is widely recognized as a powerful means of cultivating well-rounded future talent. However, challenges such as difficulties in observation, declining learning interests, and the lack of teaching resources present obstacles to the implementation of STEM education in China. Virtual Reality (VR), with its immersive, interactive, and imaginative capabilities, has the potential to enhance STEM learning by expanding the boundaries of the physical classroom. In light of these considerations and the fact that STEM activities frequently involve project-based learning (PBL), this research conducted a VR-integrated STEM PBL course entitled ""Bird Feeder"" at a primary school in Guangzhou. The main goal of this research was to investigate how the ""VR + STEM"" course affected students' comprehension of scientific knowledge, students' design and the acceptance of teacher and students. Twenty-seven Grade 6 students (aged 11-12) participated in the course which comprised four lessons. Two VR coursewares with specific content were developed and used as interventions during the course. Data was collected through pre- and post-tests of scientific knowledge, analysis of students' design drafts, observation of VR learning activities, and interviews. Results from the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test (p = 0.000) and content analysis indicated that the ""VR + STEM"" course significantly improved students' understanding of scientific concepts, enhanced their design skills, and was well-received by both teachers and students. These findings suggest that VR-based STEM project in primary schools is both feasible and effective in addressing the challenges facing STEM education.","Xie, Yishan Zhang, Xinhua",,"Xie, YS Zhang, XH",939,"[Xie, Yishan; Zhang, Xinhua] Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Greater Bay Area STEM Ed, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.

"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) is faced with challenges, resulting in learners' poor performance especially in rural areas. Previous studies have shown that mobile learning can be used to alleviate the challenges faced in STEM education in rural areas. Despite the opportunities that mobile learning can bring to STEM education, very little is known about high school STEM learners', their teachers', and parents' acceptance of mobile learning, particularly in rural settings. This study proposed and used the High School's Acceptance of Mobile Learning Model to investigate the factors that predict rural high school STEM learners', their parents', and teachers' behavioural intention to use mobile learning for STEM learning. The High School's Acceptance of Mobile Learning Model is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Stratified random sampling was used to select 550 survey participants. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyse data from 417 valid questionnaires. The proposed model explained 40.8% of the variance in learners', teachers', and parents' acceptance of mobile learning. The original TAM variables (perceived attitude, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use) had direct relationship with behavioural intention, and they also played mediating roles between the external variables and behavioural intention. Multigroup analysis results showed that, for parents and learners, three paths were significantly different. In contrast, all paths were not statistically significant different for learners and teachers.

"A new paradigm in the implementation of engineering programme outcomes assessment has emerged throughout Malaysia since the introduction of Outcomes -based Education (OBE) by the Engineering Accreditation Council of Malaysia in 2005. Despite the fact that OBE has been in place for over seventeen years, Malaysian Higher Learning Institutions (HLIs) continue to face challenges in effectively assessing programme outcomes. This research aimed to explore the challenges faced by academic staff when assessing programme outcomes at HLIs. The research was guided by the theory of sustainable assessment, as well as the key barriers identified by previous researchers that hinder academic staff from changing assessment practices. A qualitative methodology was employed, involving interviews with 18 participants to gain a comprehensive understanding of programme outcomes assessment in HLIs. The data was analysed using a constant comparative method, and themes were systematically examined and reported using Strauss and Corbin's coding analytical framework. The research revealed various emerging themes, including the need to change academic staff's mindset and increase their exposure to assessment, implementing effective HLI initiatives to enhance outcomes assessment, securing support from accreditation bodies to reduce assessment workload, establishing a robust outcomesbased support system, and working with dedicated and enthusiastic leaders. Based on the findings, sustainable practices for assessing engineering programme outcomes were proposed. These practices aim to address the challenges faced by HLIs and academic staff in engineering and other Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education settings, foster the exchange of best practices, and improve the overall quality of STEM education globally.","Liew, Chia pao Puteh, Marlia Mohammad, Shahrin Kiew, Peck loo Tan, Kim geok",,"Liew, CP Puteh, M Mohammad, S Kiew, PL Tan, KG",216,"[Liew, Chia pao] Xiamen Univ Malaysia, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, Selangor 43900, Malaysia.

"This text focuses on the analysis of key tensions within Latin American school education, with a specific focus on the Chilean context, arising in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and intertwining with pre-existing critical situations. It identifies intra-system tensions, namely, a significant decline in learning outcomes, a growing rise in disengagement from schooling, and critical issues regarding school climate. Subsequently, it addresses macropolitical concerns linked to state rigidity, the diminishing social value of schools, authorities, and educators, as well as emerging demands to which schools lack clear responses. These elements present significant challenges for new designs and practices in schools, which educational leaders must consider in light of the increasing and simultaneous tasks they face.","Donoso-Diaz, Sebastian",e3625,"Donoso-Díaz, S",,"[Donoso-Diaz, Sebastian] Univ San Sebastian, Fac Ciencias Educ, Santiago, Chile.",Universidad San Sebastian,,,,,2025-01-19,educational administration; educational managers; strategic challenges; social tensions; post-pandemic; school management training,10.22235/pe.v17i1.3625,Article,,1688-7468,donoso.sebastian@gmail.com,,,,,UC0A9,,1,PAGINAS EDUC,Paginas Educ.,Spanish,,67,gold,,"AVE 8 DE OCTUBRE, 2738, MONTEVIDEO, 11600, URUGUAY",JAN-JUN,16,MONTEVIDEO,,,J,"UNIV CATOLICA URUGUAY, FAC CIENCIAS HUMANAS",2024,,"Donoso-Díaz, S (corresponding author), Univ San Sebastian, Fac Ciencias Educ, Santiago, Chile.",Education & Educational Research,,1688-5287,PAGINAS DE EDUCACION,,,0,Tensions and Challenges of School Educational Leadership in the Post-Pandemic,2,3,WOS:001245733700002,17,,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),0
"INTRODUCTION. The growing interest around STEM teachings is the result of the urgent need for professionals in the scientific -technological added to the need to promote scientific literacy among citizens. This way, the society will be able to face the great current socio-scientific problems. The active contribution of emerging technologies as facilitators of the teaching -learning process are pre- sented as a key tool to promote STEM vocations, develop scientific work skills and improve the in- terpretation of processes and concepts. METHOD. This paper introduces a compilation of theoreti- cal and applied research to the scientific community, that sheds light to the important role of new technologies in STEM Education, and also the needs of future research. RESULTS. The included research papers show that scientific production in this field has experienced an exponential growth in recent years, with an exponential growth in the application of virtual reality in STEM areas. Vir- tual simulations pose different challenges for their effective implementation, either if they are deve- loped through virtual reality or as an interactive virtual environment. On the one hand, it is crucial to determine the validity of applets as facilitators of scientific learning; on the other hand, it is also important to know the teacher's competences in the use of these technologies for STEM education. Finally, clear evidence is shown about how simulations and virtual laboratories improve scientific technological teaching as well as the construction of mental models. DISCUSSION. These results allow us to focus on deepening in the development of new technologies, as well as in the complex task of selecting the most suitable simulators, and in the training needs for teachers.","Palacios, Alicia Pascual, Virginia Moreno-mediavilla, Daniel",,"Palacios, A Pascual, V Moreno-mediavilla, D",11,"[Palacios, Alicia] Univ Int La Rioja UNIR, Univ Didact Fis & Quim Educ Secundaria, La Rioja, Spain.

"In an increasingly competitive world, it has been proved that invention, development, and profusion of new technologies through science and technology are the fundamental source of economic progress. Australia, which is one of the world leaders in education and India, which has the capacity to produce the highest number of young skilled manpower to lead the world, both understand the current situation and have signalled their commitment to restoring the national strategy for STEM education. The proposed study focuses on a comparative understanding of the interplay of inclusive policies, government's initiatives, knowledge gap from the literature and potential future challenges that Australia and India could face in STEM education at the school level. The question we asked is: what are the important inferences and best practices in STEM education that can be mutually beneficial to broaden the Strategic Partnership? It is identified that the governments of both the countries are determined to utilise the young population to train them as skilled workforce in order to meet the future demand of industries. Australia's constructivist approach to education and the well-defined system of vocational training outperform India, which is still following the traditional approach. However, Australia has failed to engage students adequately in STEM and needs to revisit the efficacy of the current education model, while India needs to espouse the well-defined Australian framework, which could help to enhance quality infrastructure, curriculum, constructivist teaching and transparent policy implementation. In addition, both the nations must work hard to attract bright students in the teaching profession in order to promote a conducive environment for scientific learning.","Sharma, Jyoti Yarlagadda, Prasad K.

"BackgroundCreativity is one of the key competencies for the talent of the 21st century to meet future challenges in a complex world. It is also an innovative basis for students to discover and pose questions.PurposeThis study aimed to explore which two interventions of the problem-oriented teaching model, teacher-guided problem finding (TGPF) and teacher-directed question posing (TDQP), was more effective in terms of improving students' creativity in STEM education.SampleA total of 60 seventh-grade students participated in this study.Design and methodsThe TGPF group included 30 students who adopted the problem-finding method in which the teacher guided them to find problems, while another 30 students in the TDQP group adopted the method in which the teacher directly posed the questions. The Williams Creativity Aptitude Test (WCAT) was used to test the pre- and post-creativity of the two groups. Paired samples t tests were used to verify whether the two interventions of the problem-oriented teaching model could enhance students' creativity, and independent samples t tests were used to verify the differences between the two interventions of the problem-oriented teaching model in the enhancement of creativity.ResultsThe results indicated that both TGPF and TDQP can improve students' creativity. Compared with the TDQP group, the TGPF group's students could better improve their creativity, especially in the dimensions of adventure, imagination, and challenge.ConclusionThis study provides references for teachers to use different problem-oriented teaching interventions in STEM education. Teachers should break from the previous approach of direct problem posing to the creation of situations and other methods to guide students to actively think of and discover problems, so as to better improve students' creativity.","Hu, Xiaoyong Li, Wanyi Geng, Xingyu Zhao, Li",,"Hu, XY Li, WY Geng, XY Zhao, L",1230,"[Hu, Xiaoyong; Li, Wanyi] South China Normal Univ, Sch Informat Technol Educ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.

"This scoping review examines the development and application of sustainability competence frameworks in secondary education worldwide, identifying key trends and challenges in the field. An initial pool of 2659 peer-reviewed publications from 2003 to 2023 were subjected to a rigorous, multi-stage screening process, resulting in a refined selection for in-depth analysis. Through qualitative clustering, the review identifies two primary perspectives on sustainability competencies. The first perspective emphasizes transversal competencies, applicable across diverse educational contexts, including national policies, global educational guidelines, various subject areas, and innovative teaching and learning approaches. The second perspective focuses on specific frameworks that address the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of sustainability. The review highlights a global consensus on the importance of key competencies such as critical thinking, systems thinking, and action competence, which are essential for preparing secondary students to address sustainability challenges. Additionally, it underscores the need for a holistic approach to competence development that integrates cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. Despite this consensus, the review identifies a research bias, with a predominance of studies from Europe, particularly Germany and Sweden, and calls for increased regional diversity and collaboration in future research.","Sposab, Kate Rieckmann, Marco",10228,"Sposab, K Rieckmann, M",,"[Sposab, Kate; Rieckmann, Marco] Univ Vechta, Fac 1, Dept Educ, D-49377 Vechta, Germany.",,,,,,2025-01-19,sustainability competencies; education for sustainable development; secondary school education; literature review; scoping review,10.3390/su162310228,Article,,2071-1050,kate.sposab@mail.uni-vechta.de; marco.rieckmann@uni-vechta.de,,,Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD); Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) (German Academic Exchange Service),This research was funded by Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) (German Academic Exchange Service) in the form of a PhD scholarship (Hilde Domin-Program) granted to Kate Sposab.,P4R6L,KEY COMPETENCES; TEACHER; THINKING; ESD,23,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,English,,110,gold,,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",DEC,29,BASEL,,,J,MDPI,2024,,"Sposab, K (corresponding author), Univ Vechta, Fac 1, Dept Educ, D-49377 Vechta, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,SUSTAINABILITY,,,0,Development of Sustainability Competencies in Secondary School Education: A Scoping Literature Review,0,0,WOS:001377802800001,16,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),0
"Although bilingual education has been offered in some schools of Sri Lanka since 2001, primary and secondary school education has been conducted mainly in the first language (L1), that is, Sinhala/Tamil. As a result, most stu-dents sit for the General Certificate of Education - Advanced Level (GCE (A/L) examination, which determines university entry, in their L1. Thus, the majority of students entering state universities do so after receiving their entire edu-cation in their L1. At the tertiary level, where many (if not most) degree pro-grams are conducted in the English medium, students struggle to make the transition from Sinhala/Tamil medium instruction to English medium instruc-tion (EMI).1 This study examines the challenges faced by students and lectur-ers in three selected state universities due to this language transition. It em-ploys a qualitative research design. Data were collected through official docu-ments and semi-structured interviews with forty academics. Three focus group interviews were conducted with thirty undergraduates. In addition, eighteen non - participant lectures were observed in mainstream2 classrooms. The findings indi-cate several structural, institutional, and linguistic challenges on the way to a suc-cessful implementation of EMI in state universities and demonstrate that the tran-sition from GCE (A/L) to EMI in universities is a challenging experience for both stu-dents and lecturers. We propose that the concept of academic literacies be used as a productive means of supporting undergraduates through their transition to EMI.","Mahawattha, Nadee Rassool, Romola",,"Mahawattha, N Rassool, R",293,"[Mahawattha, Nadee] Sabaragamuwa Univ Sri Lanka, Belihuloya, Sri Lanka.

"This article explores the diverse challenges encountered by the school education system in Kashmir, a region marked by armed conflict and the unparalleled disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The author examines how these dual lockdowns, one political and the other viral, have profoundly impacted school education in Kashmir. A region known for violent instability, Kashmir has seen generations of students grapple with the closure of schools, intermittent curfews and a pervasive sense of insecurity. COVID-19 added a new layer of complexity to an already fragile educational landscape. Lockdowns, social distancing measures and the transition to online learning exacerbated the challenges already faced by Kashmiri students and educators. Employing descriptive qualitative research methods, the study presented here investigated the magnitude of disruption in school education, delving into the psychological impact on students, the adaptability of educators, and the accessibility of online learning tools within the dual lockdown scenario. The study adopted a multifaceted approach to assess the varied effects of both armed conflict and COVID-19 on education, encompassing dimensions such as security concerns, academic stress, teaching methodologies and students' overall well-being. The findings underline the necessity for policy discourse to address the unique challenges faced by stakeholders amid the double lockdown caused by armed conflict and COVID-19.

"The experience of interbeing - or a deep, authentic feeling of the continuum between our inner-selves, each other and the natural world - gives a profound sense of interconnectedness. Teachings of interbeing have roots in ancient knowledges yet offer insight into how we might respond collectively and purposefully to the challenges of today. It is also proposed as a core meta-competency contributing to resilience and wellbeing for young people, creating a sense of unity in response to fragmented and technologically mediated environments. This article explores what learning activities and environments support experiences of interbeing and how these might be integrated into secondary school education, focusing on transformative, place-based learning. We present findings from participatory action research in an Australian secondary school undertaken as a pilot program focused on building resilience and wellbeing for students - and contribute ideas for transformative learning practices that support resilience in the face of uncertain futures.","Potts, Monique Le Hunte, Bem Ross, Katie",,"Potts, M Le Hunte, B Ross, K",42,"[Potts, Monique; Le Hunte, Bem] Univ Technol Sydney, TD Sch, 15 Broadway, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.

"An expanding literature focuses on the so-called shadow education system of private supplementary tutoring, and contributes to understandings of the nexus between in-school and out-of-school learning. This paper, contextualised in broader literature, draws on questionnaire and interview data from students, teachers, principals, parents and other stakeholders in Myanmar, and observes that shadow education may subtract as well as supplement. For some decades, public education in Myanmar has suffered from financial stringency, large classes, and overloaded curriculum. Students and their families have sought private tutoring, particularly from public school teachers, to supplement school education; and teachers and other providers have welcomed the revenue that they can earn. As a result, private tutoring has become embedded in the lives of many students and teachers, and has consumed time and energy supposed to be spent on school education. However, the private tutoring has also helped to keep the school system running.","Liu, Junyan Bray, Mark",102213,"Liu, JY Bray, M",,"[Liu, Junyan] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Int Res Supplementary Tutoring, Inst Curriculum & Instruct, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

"Cross reality laboratories are widely used in education, yet research on the usability/user experience (UX) of these laboratories is still lacking. This study wants to start the discussion about challenges for usability/UX by interviewing practitioners from a large project for cross reality laboratories spanning multiple institutes in Germany. A total of 18 challenges were discovered, together with three target groups, namely, developers, maintainers, and learners. In addition, the tension between developers and usability is discussed. Open questions include the need to conduct further research with different target groups and how to increase usability for laboratory developers. Since cross reality laboratories play an important role in education, they should provide good usability. Yet, multiple challenges arise while providing such laboratories, which were collected through interviews with ten laboratory creators from a large cross reality laboratory project in Germany spanning multiple institutions. image","Kobras, Louis Soll, Marcus Herrmann, Franziska Bock, Annette",,"Kobras, L Soll, M Herrmann, F Bock, A",1516,"[Kobras, Louis; Soll, Marcus; Herrmann, Franziska; Bock, Annette] NORDAKADEMIE gAG Hsch Wirtschaft, Kollner Chaussee 11, D-25337 Elmshorn, Germany.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Cross reality laboratories; Expert interview; STEM education; User experience,10.1002/cite.202400060,Article,SEP 2024,1522-2640,louis.kobras@nordakademie.de,1521,,"Stiftung Innovation in der Hochschullehre, Germany; Projekt DEAL","This research was part of the project ""Flexibel kombinierbare Cross-Reality Labore in der Hochschullehre: zukunftsfaehige Kompetenzentwicklung fuer ein Lernen und Arbeiten 4.0 (CrossLab)"", which is funded by the Stiftung Innovation in der Hochschullehre, Germany.Open access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.",L0S9P,,11,CHEM-ING-TECH,Chem.

"In this phenomenological investigation we used qualitative research methodology to examine the experiences of 8 African American women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduate programs at 1 predominantly White university (PWU) in the South. Much of the current research in this area uses quantitative methods and only yields descriptive statistical information. By using qualitative methods, we sought to add significant context to currently available literature about the experiences of African American women in STEM graduate programs at PWUs. We conducted semistructured interviews with research participants. Additionally, participants completed a demographic questionnaire to give us more information about their backgrounds. We analyzed these sources of data to help understand participant experiences. Verbatim quotes from participant interviews were used to highlight experiences and give voice to an often silenced student population in graduate STEM education. Results indicated that participants experienced racial microaggressions, low self-efficacy, and a lack of institutional support while pursuing STEM graduate degrees at this PWU. We offer suggestions about ways issues revealed by participants might be addressed by PWU university personnel. Attention to these issues could make the experiences for African American women more positive while pursuing graduate STEM degrees.","Alexander, Quentin R.

"In preparation for the future of work, developed economies face two critical challenges related to their STEM workforces. The first is the need to increase female participation, as women remain underrepresented in these disciplines. The second is the need, in a rapidly digitalizing world, to equip workers with abilities that cannot be easily replaced by artificial intelligence and automation. Could creativity be the solution to both challenges? Building on existing scholarship, this study proposes Creative Self-Efficacy (CSE) as being an essential component of STEM education, necessary to support both increased female participation and proper preparation for the demands of the future of work. A quantitative study was conducted with 2,123 Australian students, across Years 6 to 12, to examine the role of CSE in STEM subjects. The analyses compare the CSE levels between STEM and non-STEM disciplines, between genders and examine the differences in the correlation between CSE and intention for further study between the different year groups. The most relevant finding of this paper is that CSE correlates with the decision to continue studying STEM and non-STEM subjects, both for female and male students. Further implications and practical methodologies to stimulate this construct in STEM classrooms are proposed.","Vieira, Maria Kennedy, Johnpaul Leonard, Simon N.

"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is essential for developing future-ready learners in both secondary and higher education levels. However, as students transition to higher education, many encounter challenges with independent learning and research. This can negatively impact their Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS), engagement, and practical expertise. This study introduces a solution: Computational Thinking Scaffolding (CTS) in the Jupyter Notebook environment, designed to enhance STEM education at the tertiary level. CTS incorporates five phases: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Algorithm Design, and Evaluation. Utilizing a quasi-experimental method, we assessed the impact of CTS on the HOTS, engagement, and practical skills of undergraduate and postgraduate students. Our findings hold substantial relevance for university educators, academic advisors, and curriculum designers aiming to enhance students' HOTS and hands-on capabilities in STEM disciplines. The results validate the effectiveness of CTS in elevating tertiary STEM learning outcomes, and they spotlight the adaptability of the Jupyter Notebook as a valuable tool in higher education. In conclusion, our research underscores the merits of CTS for improving outcomes in higher STEM education and sets a benchmark for future endeavors in this domain.","Lee, Hsin-Yu Wu, Ting-Ting Lin, Chia-Ju Wang, Wei-Sheng Huang, Yueh-Min",,"Lee, HY Wu, TT Lin, CJ Wang, WS Huang, YM",431,"[Lee, Hsin-Yu; Lin, Chia-Ju; Wang, Wei-Sheng; Huang, Yueh-Min] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, Tainan, Taiwan.

"This paper reports the findings from a cross-sector research project designed to question how the development of university-school partnerships can influence university academics' pedagogic practice in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Findings from this research are offered at time when, in parallel with countries around the world, universities and schools in England are being encouraged to review and reflect on the quality of teaching and professional development, in line with the Teaching Excellence Framework consultation (2016) and the Standards for Professional Development (Department for Education 2016b) (Bianchi 2017). This paper seeks to develop a coherent response to two major issues; the policy imperative to develop greater science expertise in schools and to improve the quality of teaching and learning of science in higher education institutions. The research seeks to advance the notion of critical reflection on the quality of cross-sector STEM teaching and learning, by moving to what the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) (2015, p.15) terms a ""'meso' networked level"" of professional development in STEM education. This paper highlights how interpreting the imperative of constant change in education reform as a relational, outward looking endeavour offers the potential to help both universities and schools to better address the global education challenges that lie ahead.","Ralls, Deborah Bianchi, Lynne Choudry, Sophina",,"Ralls, D Bianchi, L Choudry, S",2463,"[Ralls, Deborah; Bianchi, Lynne] Univ Manchester, Fac Sci & Engn, Sci & Engn Educ Res & Innovat Hub, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.

"In recent years, the rapid growth of virtual reality has opened up new possibilities for creating immersive virtual worlds known as metaverses. With advancements in technology, such as virtual reality headsets, and the emergence of applications with social interaction, metaverses offer exciting opportunities for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. This article proposes the integration of metaverses into STEM courses, enabling students to forge connections between different subjects within their curriculum, to leverage current technological advancements, and to revolutionize project presentations and audience interaction. Drawing upon a case study conducted with students enrolled in the ""Proyectos RII 1: Organizacion y Escenarios"" course at the Escuela Politecnica Superior de Alcoy of the Technical University of Valencia (Spain), this article provides a comprehensive description of the methodology employed by the students and professors. It outlines the process followed, shedding light on the innovative use of metaverses in their projects. Moreover, the article shares valuable insights obtained through surveys and personal opinions gathered from students throughout the course and upon its completion. By exploring the intersection of metaverses and STEM education, this study showcases the transformative potential of integrating interactive virtual environments. Furthermore, this work highlights the benefits of increased student engagement, motivation, and collaboration, as well as the novel ways in which projects can be presented and interactions with audiences can be redefined.","Solanes, J.

"Today's society is facing new challenges and opportunities that demand professional profiles specialized in problem solving, with the ability to innovate and exploit the possibilities offered by information and communication technologies (ICTs). Far from being a novelty, the term STEM was coined in the mid-1990s. From then until now, there are a multitude of initiatives focusing on working STEM education with students. In recent years, the use of the arts as an enhancer of the educational experience has been incorporated into STEM education. There has also been a focus on involving the student in the educational process. Despite this, few experiences have been detected in which parents are involved in the educational process. Throughout this work, it is shown the pilot experience which has been developed to motivate parents to be part of the learning process in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) subjects.","Menacho, Antonio Plaza, Pedro Sancristobal, Elio Perez-Molina, Clara Blazquez, Manuel Castro, Manuel",,"Menacho, A Plaza, P Sancristóbal, E Perez-Molina, C Blazquez, M Castro, M",406,"[Menacho, Antonio; Plaza, Pedro; Sancristobal, Elio; Perez-Molina, Clara; Blazquez, Manuel; Castro, Manuel] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Madrid 28850, Spain.",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),,,,,2025-01-19,Conferences; Robots; Education; Tools; Programming profession; STEM; Art; Education; programming; robotics; science; technology; engineering; art; and mathematics (STEAM),10.1109/TE.2021.3066891,Article,,1557-9638,amenacho6@alumno.uned.es; pplaza@ieec.uned.es; elio@ieec.uned.es; clarapm@ieec.uned.es; mblazquez@ieec.uned.es; mcastro@ieec.uned.es,412,,"Madrid Regional Government [P2018/TCS-4307]; Structural Fund (FSE ); Structural Fund (FEDER); UNED [GID2016-17]; Vicerectorate of Innovation and Digitalization; e-LIVES project, e-Learning InnoVative Engineering Solutions-Erasmus+ Capacity Building in Higher Education 2017 [585938-EPP-12017-1-FR-EPPKA2-CBHE-J]; I4EU project-Key Competences for an European Model of Industry 4.0, Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership [2019-1-FR01-KA202-06296]; ECoVEM project, European Centre of Vocational Excellence in Microelectronics-Erasmus + KA3-Dedicated VET Tools, Centres of Vocational Excellence [620101-EPP-1-2020-1-BG-EPPKA3-VET-COVE]","This work was supported in part by the Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM (P2018/TCS-4307) co-financed by the Structural Funds (FSE and FEDER) as well as to the Teaching Innovation Group of the UNED GID2016-17, G-TAEI; in part by the 2020 UNED Innovation in Education Projects from the Vicerectorate of Innovation and Digitalization ""Evaluacion de la Compresion Conceptual Mediante Tecnicas de Redes Asociativas y Mineria Textual en el Ambito de Electronica Digital""; in part by the e-LIVES project, e-Learning InnoVative Engineering Solutions-Erasmus+ Capacity Building in Higher Education 2017 under Grant 585938-EPP-12017-1-FR-EPPKA2-CBHE-J; in part by the I4EU project-Key Competences for an European Model of Industry 4.0, Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership under Grant 2019-1-FR01-KA202-06296; and in part by the ECoVEM project, European Centre of Vocational Excellence in Microelectronics-Erasmus + KA3-Dedicated VET Tools, Centres of Vocational Excellence under Grant 620101-EPP-1-2020-1-BG-EPPKA3-VET-COVE.",WN2WC,GENDER-GAP; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; STEM; MOTIVATION; PLATFORM; IMPACT; GAME,4,IEEE T EDUC,IEEE Trans.

"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) OpenCourseWare (OCW) was launched in 2001. It is one of the earliest Open Educational Resources (OER). MIT OCW has published more than 2,400 courses which are available at no cost, the majority of which are STEM related. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the pedagogical strategies through reviewing instructor insights of 15 MIT OCW STEM courses using thematic analysis. The most effective pedagogical strategies used found by instructors were active learning, personalizing instruction, engaging learners, providing feedback, building learning community, and clarifying learning objective. Instructors used in-class formative assessment, such as quizzes and oral exams, for just-in-time teaching and online automatic assessment environments for students' self-assessment. The primary summative assessments were final exams and projects. Instructors encountered challenges such as assessing students' learning and changing pedagogical beliefs. Implications for practice were discussed as well.","Zhu, Meina",,"Zhu, MN",257,"[Zhu, Meina] Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",Wayne State University,,,,,2025-01-19,OER; MIT open courseware; STEM education; electrical engineering education; computer science education; pedagogical strategies,10.5944/openpraxis.12.2.1074,Article,,,meinazhu@wayne.edu,270,,OER Fellowship,"This research was completed as a part of the OER Fellowship honored to the first author by the Open Education Group.

"The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) provides numerous provisions to support science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). These provisions do not necessarily address persistent achievement and opportunity gaps. We contend that if states, districts, and local schools capitalize on the autonomy provided in the ESSA, access, equity, and achievement in STEM can be attainable to traditionally underserved populations of learners. The purpose of this article is to review the enumerated provisions pertinent to STEM and, based on these provisions, present recommendations to support access, equity, and achievement in STEM content areas. Our review indicates that the ESSA presents provisions in five areas related to STEM education: (1) standards, (2) assessments, (3) accountability, (4) teacher effectiveness, and (5) well-rounded education. Using these five areas as an organizational framework, we provide recommendations to support enduring challenges related to equity, access, and achievement in STEM education. These recommendations are based on current high-yield practices used to support equity, access, and achievement in STEM content.","Young, Jamaal Capraro, Mary Margaret Capraro, Robert Cason, Marti",130309,"Young, J Capraro, MM Capraro, R Cason, M",,"[Young, Jamaal] Univ North Texas, Coll Educ, Denton, TX 76203 USA.

"This report explores the integration of problem-based learning, gamification, and data-driven approaches in engineering education. With a focus on the course ""GeoGovernment 1"", this framework aimed to engage students actively and foster self-directed learning. By tackling real-world issues like automated teller machine (ATM) burglaries in Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), students gained experience in data analyses and geoinformatics technology. This approach not only motivated students but also enhanced their prospects in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, equipping them with skills necessary for their future careers. The course structure emphasized student-centered learning, with educators playing facilitative roles to provide guidance. In summary, the combination of problem-based learning, gamification, and data-driven approaches offers a promising solution to address the challenges faced by STEM education, providing an engaging and effective learning experience for students, and ultimately preparing them for the demands of the ever-evolving professional landscape.","Cubela, Dino Rossner, Alexander Neis, Pascal",1223,"Cubela, D Rossner, A Neis, P",,"[Cubela, Dino] Mainz Univ Appl Sci, Learning Lab, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.

"This study aims to provide a bibliometric analysis on the topic of the simple spectrophotometer. By using the VOSviewer software, bibliometric analysis methods from 128 articles were used in this study. The articles were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria predefined. The results of this study indicate that several simple spectrophotometer instruments have been used for teaching and learning in chemistry and other STEM areas, such as UV-Vis and photometers. This instrument was built by replacing the main components in the spectrophotometer, such as the light source and detector, to be simpler. The development of other types of spectrophotometers that involve students in building them can be a potential research alternative in Chemistry and other STEM areas. This research is expected to provide a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities of using a simple spectrophotometer for teaching and learning purposes.","Shidiq, Ari Syahidul Permanasari, Anna Hernani Hendayana, Sumar",,"Shidiq, AS Permanasari, A Hernani Hendayana, S",290,"[Shidiq, Ari Syahidul] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Sci Educ Program, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung, Indonesia.",Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia,,,,,2025-01-19,Bibliometrics; Simple Spectrophotometer; STEM Education,10.48317/IMIST.PRSM/morjchem-v9i2.27581,Article,,,arishidiq@upi.edu,300,,,,TZ1UP,LOW-COST; SMARTPHONE COLORIMETRY; ANALYTICAL-CHEMISTRY; LIGHT-SOURCE; PHOTOMETER; SPECTROSCOPY; CONSTRUCTION; WATER; SPECTROMETER; FLUOROMETER,2,MOROC J CHEM,Moroc.

"Empathy, an unsung, yet critical element of learning, can be strategically interlaced with literacy instruction and engineering design to create a rich and authentic learning experience for students. Integrated STEM education rests on the promise of engaging students and providing deep understandings through the intentional practice of delivering science and math content through the application of technology and engineering skills. Using children's literature to activate empathy and design thinking can help students become better problem-solvers, critical thinkers, and caring members of society. Empathy facilitates a deeper connection to the human experience, ensuring that solutions not only meet the design requirements, but also address the emotions and concerns of the end user. Building upon story grammar, students can understand the needs of characters in narratives and create empathetic solutions to the challenges that characters in a book may face, ultimately helping students develop confidence and embrace their future possibilities.","Cheek, Leah R.

"For more than 3 decades, education researchers have called on teachers to use funds of knowledge (FoK) as a way of creating more culturally relevant, responsive, and sustaining pedagogies. This is particularly important in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, specifically mathematics and science. FoK research in this area has addressed how teachers have made connections to STEM, planned curriculum, and the challenges of integrating funds in STEM education. There remains a dearth of research on the process of gathering, selecting, planning, and implementing science-funds in particular. In this article, we conceptualize how FoK research can move toward more dynamic and hybrid forms of teaching and learning through positioning theory. Positioning theory provides a valuable framework for how teachers can gather, select, plan, and implement English learners' science-funds to teach the science standards by repositioning the role of language, nonschool funds, and interaction in the classroom.","Razfar, Aria Nasir, Ambareen",,"Razfar, A Nasir, A",226,"[Razfar, Aria] Univ Illinois, Educ & Linguist, Chicago, IL USA.

"This study aimed to examine the trends in grants for STEM/STEAM education in Japan as well as Japanese students' perception of science learning and future careers. The grants were addressed through analysis of chronological trends, while student perceptions were reviewed through student questionnaires on Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011, 2015, and 2019. The results reflect ideas on not only STEM education, which is often treated in the context of workforce development and science/mathematics education in Japan, but also ideas on the rapid expansion of and changes to STEAM education around 2015, which seems to be intended the integration of multiple subjects. In contrast, the results showed that students' perceptions of science and engineering careers are improving, but there are still challenges. Since subject-integrated learning has already been conducted in Japan, we consider the further discussion required regarding specific objective of STEAM versus STEM education.","Matsuura, Takuya Nakamura, Daiki",,"Matsuura, T Nakamura, D",7,"[Matsuura, Takuya] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398524, Japan.

"Cloud computing is becoming a leading trend worldwide, due to its enhanced reliability, scalability, flexibility, availability and processing throughput. However, the decision related to adoption of the cloud computing model is often complicated by challenges and uncertainties about the expected business value and its overall impact on the organisation. Till date, different contemporary technology acceptance theories and models have been used to test and validate adoption chances of cloud computing at organisational and individual levels. However, no experimental study has been conducted to provide a holistic evaluation of the determinants of cloud computing in the Asian world particularly in the context of the Indian school education system. Due to lack of such studies, we propose a theoretical model based on the TOE framework to explain the role of technological, organisational and environmental factors on the adoption of cloud computing in the Indian school education system. The data was collected from fifty-six 56 randomly selected secondary schools through questionnaire based survey to examine the relationship between the variables employing 5-points Likert scale. Reliability and validity measures were used to establish the quality and the usefulness of the collected data. In addition multi co-linearity test was also conducted. In order to test the research hypothesis, multiple regression analysis was conducted. The results indicate that relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity representing technological factors; top management support representing organisational factors; and competitive pressure, external expertise and attitude towards change representing environmental factors were found to have an positive and significant influence on the adoption of cloud computing services in the Indian school education system. The findings have a great significance since they can provide knowledge about cloud computing factors as well as insights and directions to the education policy planners and decision makers for successful adoption of cloud computing technology in India.","Singh, Jewan Mansotra, Vibhakar",,"Singh, J Mansotra, V",2453,"[Singh, Jewan] AMET Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept IT, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

"In the academic sphere, the debate on the development of specific and differentiated teaching materials for indigenous peoples has been frequent in order to break with their invisibility in the context of school education. To investigate how this debate permeates the works defended in postgraduate programs in Brazil and seeking answers on how this scientific production is configured, an exploratory and descriptive research was conducted, conducted with bibliometric and content approaches. Data were collected at the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (BDTD / IBICT) using the expressions ""indigenous teaching materials"" and ""indigenous teaching books"", which resulted in dissertations (n=29) and theses (n=3). The bibliometric analysis of the works revealed the temporal evolution (1996-2018), the institutions (n=17), geographic regions (n=5) and areas of the graduate programs (n=11). The content analysis exposed the objectives (n=4); the typology of teaching materials (n=8); the educational levels (n=2), the subjects (n=5) and the ethnic groups (n=42) to which these teaching materials are destined. It was concluded that, in the scope of postgraduate studies, there are still few works that accepted the challenges and complexity inherent to the elaboration and analysis of specific didactic materials in the context of indigenous school education, requiring a more critical look at the representation and participation of indigenous people in the preparation of these materials.","Piumbato Innocentini Hayash, Maria Cristina Maroldi, Alexandre Masson Massao Hayashi, Carlos Roberto",e9151,"Hayash, MCPI Maroldi, AM Hayashi, CRM",,"[Piumbato Innocentini Hayash, Maria Cristina; Massao Hayashi, Carlos Roberto] Univ Fed Sao Carlos UFSCar, Dept Ciencias Informacao, Programas Posgrad Educ Educ & Ciencia Tecnol & So, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.

"In the midst of an expanding knowledge-based economy, there remains a policy emphasis on increasing the number of professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) within the United States. In addition to a general interest in increasing STEM pathways for all students, there have been concentrated efforts to expand opportunities and STEM-related academic achievement for Black and Latinx students because of their underrepresentation in many of these fields. This critical quantitative study employs large-scale national data to examine an important outcome for Black and Latinx students'STEM academic trajectories-their math achievement during high school. A strength-based role strain and adaptation approach is employed to investigate how students'math challenges and math-related multilevel strengths (i.e., positive psychological attributes and social supports) combine to influence their math achievement. Furthermore, we examine how the relationship between students'strengths and achievement may be moderated by their prior math challenges. The findings suggest that some aspects of Black and Latinx students' strengths (e.g., math identity, math self-efficacy, and math-related social support) are positively related to their achievement; however, in some instances, the nature of these relationships may differ according to students'prior math challenges. Based upon these findings, the authors advance a theory of strain-induced performance-perception misalignment that emphasizes how students'prior math challenges may create a barrier to the potential benefits of positive math-related psychological orientations. Implications for the following are discussed: theory; educational practice regarding social supports and the need to change educators'psychological dispositions; and opportunity gaps and STEM education policy.","Williams, Krystal L.

"Contribution: This study uncovered specific benefits, challenges, and facilitators to participating in undergraduate research for physically disabled students (PDSs) taken directly from students themselves. Background: Disabled students (DSs) earn bachelor's degrees and gain employment in STEM careers at rates lower than their peers. The paradigm shift in undergraduate STEM education from lecture-based to inquiry-based learning is an opportunity to explore new options for including DSs. Little is known about designing inquiry-based learning settings for DSs. Research Question: This article seeks to increase the understanding of how to support PDSs in inquiry-based settings. Specifically, the authors documented the experiences of PDS in a summer undergraduate research program to uncover: 1) benefits they receive from participating; 2) specific challenges these students face; and 3) novel ways to facilitate participation. Methodology: The authors conducted semistructured interviews of five undergraduate PDS, who participated in a summer research program. The paper reports representative student responses across themes related to benefits, challenges, and facilitators of success in the program. Findings: The students enjoyed many benefits typically gained from undergraduate research, most notably career clarification. Additionally, the students experienced personal growth, including improved self-advocacy, increased confidence in their independence, and greater understanding of limitations. The main facilitator was the positive attitudes of research mentors. A principal challenge was the lack of knowledge about disability in peers without disabilities who participated in the program.","Schearer, Eric Reinthal, Ann Jackson, Debbie",,"Schearer, E Reinthal, A Jackson, D",156,"[Schearer, Eric; Reinthal, Ann] Cleveland State Univ, Ctr Human Machine Syst, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.

"The objective of this paper is to illustrate the scope, uniqueness and opportunities for Agricultural Engineering and to present an overview of Agricultural Engineering education in South Africa. The need for engineers in South Africa is assessed, and the output from the schooling system in South Africa to meet this need is illustrated. Thereafter, the performance of engineering students at the University of Natal is analysed and selected challenges and opportunities for agricultural engineers in South Africa are summarized. From the results of the study it is evident that the performance of students in their final year of school is a poor indication of their performance in their first year of engineering studies and the standard of the school education system presents challenges to tertiary engineering educational institutions that need to focus on the retention and throughput of students.","Smithers, JC",,"Smithers, JC",93,"Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Bioresources Engn & Environm Hydrol, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",University of Kwazulu Natal,,,,,2025-01-19,agricultural engineering; bioresources engineering; agricultural degree accreditation; GPA,,Article,,,smithers@ukzn.ac.za,101,,,,012RJ,,1,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

"Effective science teaching by providing students with the necessary knowledge, attitude and skills can prepare them to live in a community and face its challenges. One of the most important topics in science education is energy education, and STEM is a new approach that can be used for energy education. Solar energy was used as a suitable context in STEM-based energy education to investigate its impact on the learning and creativity of female students. The study population consisted of ninth-grade female students of the junior high school in Qarchak city in the academic year 2020-2021, and the sample consisted of 143 people who were selected by random sampling in two groups of control and experimental. The students in the experimental group underwent 5E-based STEM education in the concepts of energy and energy conversion for 7 sessions (35 min for each session) as distance learning. ANCOVA analysis showed that teaching science with the 5E-based STEM approach significantly increases creativity along with science and math learning performance in female students. The effect on creativity subscales is not the same and has a greater effect on originality and elaboration. Furthermore, There is an overlap of 50% between the top people (5%) in science and math with the top people (5%) in overall creativity in the experimental group. This overlap reaches its maximum value (75%) in the flexibility subscale.","Shahbazloo, Fatemeh Mirzaie, Rasol Abdullah",101336,"Shahbazloo, F Mirzaie, RA",,"[Shahbazloo, Fatemeh; Mirzaie, Rasol Abdullah] Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Tehran, Iran.

"Alaska faces unique challenges in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education, including limited accessibility to resources and learning opportunities, and a lack of place-based education resources. Museum education programs, traditionally focused on public outreach through docent-led tours, are playing an increasingly important role in both formal and informal aspects of STEM education to help address these challenges. The University of Alaska Museum (UAM) stands as a model in the Arctic region exemplifying how public natural history museum collections can be utilized to create active place-based learning experiences with the aim of increasing engagement in STEM literacy and building connections between museums and communities. These efforts take many forms, including the development of teaching materials involving physical objects and (or) online data from the open-access database ARCTOS, training preservice teachers, and implementing citizen science projects. Because many UAM specimens and objects are from Alaska, they are easily incorporated into place-based education, thereby demonstrating how the Arctic environment is unique at local and regional scales. Here, we showcase several programs that are either unique to UAM or part of larger national projects and include exemplar teaching modules in order to provide learning opportunities in the Arctic region and other rural settings.","Anderson, Katherine L.

"This paper is devoted to identifying online teaching strategies appropriate for blended and face-to-face higher STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. The study is inspired by the experience gained during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, which forced many higher education institutions worldwide to shift abruptly to distance education and try many new tools, teaching methods, and strategies. Some of these tools and strategies were abandoned as soon as the lockdown had been lifted and the institutions returned to their regular functioning, but some of them are bound to stay. Certainly, it would be beneficial to include the most valuable of the gained skills and competences in traditional on-campus and blended courses. The study is based on an online questionnaire, addressed to the STEM faculty of the University of Aveiro, Portugal (which is an example of an institution that used to provide face-to-face instruction), whose analysis permits to derive a number of important recommendations. The results are compared with our previous work, where the students' perspectives were analyzed, and similarities and discrepancies in appreciation of the involved parties are highlighted. This work extends the body of knowledge about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on STEM education by examining the challenges and opportunities faced by teachers. The recommendations derived contribute to improving the learning outcomes of online STEM education in many similar institutions.","Skliarova, Iouliia Meireles, Ines Tchemisova, Tatiana Cacao, Isabel Martins, Natalia",338,"Skliarova, I Meireles, I Tchemisova, T Caçao, I Martins, N",,"[Skliarova, Iouliia] Univ Aveiro, Inst Elect & Informat Engn Aveiro IEETA, Dept Elect Telecommun & Informat, Intelligent Syst Associate Lab LASI, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.

"Robotics competitions boosts the development of STEM education, but gender disparity in this field remains rarely addressed by researchers. This study focused on the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) and tried to explore the gender differences through investigation method. The research questions are as follows: RQ1, what is the tendency of girls' participation in WRO from 2015 to 2019 in terms of the four competition categories and three age groups? RQ2, what advantages and challenges do the all-girl teams have from the perspectives of parents, coaches and students? The results showed that among the 5956 participants in the 2015-2019 WRO finals, girls accounted for only 17.3%. The Open Category that emphasized creativity attracted relatively more girl participants. As age group moved up, the number of girl participants decreased. The qualitative results showed that the focuses of coaches, parents and students was not exactly the same. All-girl team have the advantages in their communication, presentation and collaboration skills but less good at robot building. The results indicated the importance of promoting girl's participation in robot competitions and STEM fields. Coaches, mentors and parents need to provide girls with more support and encouragement in learning STEM subjects, especially at the junior high school level. Organizers of related competitions should give girls more exposure and opportunities by adjusting the mechanism.","Chiang, Feng-Kuang Tang, Zhonghua Zhu, Dan Bao, Xianqing",,"Chiang, FK Tang, ZH Zhu, D Bao, XQ",629,"[Chiang, Feng-Kuang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Ctr Future Educ, Sch Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

"Underrepresented students face challenges in accessing entrepreneurial education and careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. In attempts to address this deficit, a five-week social entrepreneurship program (named Poder) with a focus on technology was implemented at one of the largest community college systems in the U.S. Conceptually, the program curriculum was grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory and Critical Consciousness, two approaches noted for helping underserved students. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the program, students from diverse backgrounds (n = 106) completed pre- and post-test measures, which included instruments assessing entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial skills, civic participation, critical behavior, technology optimism, and technology innovation. Results from paired samples t-tests and a series of repeated measures mixed-design ANOVAS suggest that students experienced significant increases in all outcome measures, except for civic participation, and effects were not moderated by race/ethnicity, gender, or immigration status. These results suggest that the program, designed with a culturally responsive curriculum, was effective in promoting the career development of culturally diverse and underrepresented students. We discuss conceptual and practical contributions for addressing educational attainment gaps and systemic issues in entrepreneurship and STEM education.","Cadenas, German A.

"In India, ICDS provides early childhood education to children (3-6 years) under the supervision of Anganwadi Teacher (AWT). The study concluded that out of 42 AWTs, the majority are Schedule caste (SC) teachers and have more than 10 years of experience and only half of the AWTs have an intermediate and above qualification. The study also revealed that three-quarters of preschool children were from the SC community, and the rest came from other communities. The vast majority of AWCs have building blocks, charts, picture books and carpets, but the vast majority (65%) lack a first aid box. As per the study, the most difficult challenges for SC AWTs in organizing preschool education are as follows: insufficient space for class activities, material storage and indoor games; children's irregularities, other responsibilities; parental migration, English medium schools and a lack of basic amenities, all of which impede proper pre-school education implementation.","Anjaneyulu, Parupally",,"Anjaneyulu, P",,"[Anjaneyulu, Parupally] CESS, SCSDF Res Unit, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Anganwadi centres; Anganwadi teachers; infrastructural facilities; pre-school education; Schedule caste,10.1177/2455328X231163387,Article; Early Access,JUN 2023,2456-0502,dranjaneyulu.cess@gmail.com,,,"Scheduled Castes Development Department (SCDD), Telangana State","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: The author received financial support for the research, from the Scheduled Castes Development Department (SCDD), Telangana State.",J4JW3,,,CONTEMP VOICE DALIT,Contemp.

"This qualitative study investigates how teachers perceive and design Small-Scale Chemistry driven STEM Learning Activities (SSC-STEM) in their teaching practice. While small-scale chemistry experiments offer numerous advantages for chemistry education, there is limited research on their integration into STEM education frameworks. This study examined teachers' understanding, perceptions, and lesson design practices when implementing SSC-STEM activities. Fifty teachers from Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines participated in SSC-STEM training. Data were collected through questionnaires that explored teachers' perceptions and analyzed their STEM lesson designs. The findings reveal that teachers demonstrate positive perceptions of SSC-STEM, particularly regarding its potential to foster STEM literacy and environmental consciousness. The analysis of lesson designs showed the successful integration of small-scale chemistry experiments with real-world environmental challenges, although teachers faced challenges in certain implementation aspects. High scores in teamwork (4.63) and self-directed learning (4.73) contrasted with lower scores in teaching performance (2.88) and teaching strategies (2.94), indicating areas needing professional development support. This study contributes to the understanding of how small-scale chemistry can be effectively integrated into STEM education while promoting sustainable development practices. These findings provide insights for teacher preparation programs and curriculum development for implementing integrated STEM approaches using small-scale chemistry experiments.","Tantayanon, Supawan Faikhamta, Chatree Prasoplarb, Tharuesean Panyanukit, Pongsatorn",,"Tantayanon, S Faikhamta, C Prasoplarb, T Panyanukit, P",,"[Faikhamta, Chatree; Prasoplarb, Tharuesean] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Educ, 50 Ngamwongwan Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.

"This article inserts itself in the discussion on the right to access school education for black populations, with a specific focus on the remaining quilombola communities, in view of the decade of National Curriculum Guidelines for Quilombola School Education. The development of educational norms, especially in the 19th and 20th centuries, evidenced ideological aspects of institutionalized powers as instruments for maintaining the status quo of the dominant classes. In opposition to this imposition, the black movement and social collectives fought for the construction and recognition of these rights. This negation-affirmation binomial brought a historical contradiction that became evident in the legislation focused on the right to education, building an environment of tension between the actors involved in a dialectical process. In the moment in which we live and faced with the technological and structural challenges that have already penetrated the most remote corners of traditional communities, it is urgent and necessary to understand the current scenario of these struggles for rights, in particular, the right to education.","da Silva, Leandro Ferreira Perius, Oneide",,"da Silva, LF Perius, O",258,"[da Silva, Leandro Ferreira] Univ Fed Tocantins, Grad Adm, Palmas, Brazil.

"UNESCO, OSCE/the ODIHR and the Council of Europe each have distinct ideas on the role religion will play in the education delivered in the schools of the future. However, since the publication in 2009 of ""Human Rights Education in the School Systems of Europe, Central Asia and North America: A Compendium of Good Practice"", these institutions have additionally been working together in the global education context. In awareness of and proceeding from the engagement of international stakeholders in a shared global discourse on these issues and UNESCO's status as the institution with the longest tradition of activities around religion, this article presents a diachronic qualitative and quantitative analysis of UNESCO's work relating to religion in the school education sector.

"The dialogue in the field of education is undoubtedly one of the most heated in the academic and scientific world, given its interdisciplinary and increasingly complex perspectives, especially given its inclusion challenges even in societies with great cultural diversity. The production and reproduction of knowledge within the historical, anthropological realities and resulting from the rights and public policies aimed at indigenous peoples (original peoples of Brazil) and quilombolas (traditional brazilian communities) is a challenging field for the academy, especially when considering at its core that there will always be social education and school education. This communication produces articulation between three sets of research on ethnoeducation as a subsidy for differentiated school education for indigenous and quilombolas, carried out in two public universities (UNESP and UFT) under the articulation of the research group GEDGS (Group of Studies in Democracy and Management Social), between 2015 and 2021. The first set brings complementary research funded by UNESP and CNPq on the investment of international social organizations in educational projects in traditional Amazonian communities; the second set articulates the results of two researches on public policies for indigenous education and, finally, a last research brings an important perception about orality (including intergenerational) as a vehicle for the production of school knowledge. The research, whose complete documents have already been published, converge to substantial aspects of the quality of differentiated education for indigenous people and quilombolas, which permeates ethnoeducation, in turn based on the concept of ethnodevelopment.","de Moraes, Nelson Russo Souza, Fernando da Cruz",,"de Moraes, NR Souza, FD",1,"[de Moraes, Nelson Russo; Souza, Fernando da Cruz] Univ Estadual Paulista, Tupa, SP, Brazil.",Universidade Estadual Paulista,,,,,2025-01-19,Ethnoeducation; Indigenous school education; Public education policies,10.5902/1984644464516,Article,,1984-6444,nelson.russo@unesp.br; fernando.cruz@unesp.br,40,,,,6O5HQ,,,EDUCACAO,Educacao,English,,86,gold,,"CIDADE UNIV, BAIRRO CAMOBI, SANTA MARIA, RS 97105-900, BRAZIL",,40,SANTA MARIA,,,J,UNIV FEDERAL SANTA MARIA,2022,,"de Moraes, NR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Tupa, SP, Brazil.",Education & Educational Research,,0101-9031,EDUCACAO,,,0,Ethnoeducation and differentiated basic education for indigenous peoples and quilombola communities in Brazil: a challenge for the promotion of ethnodevelopment,0,2,WOS:000890272800001,47,,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),0
"Inclusive education in pre-school education is a general policy and practice in European countries, but implementation of the policy varies from country to country depending on institutional, legal factors, funding, access to pre-school education and pedagogical concepts. The aim of the study is to analyze the practice and innovation of inclusive education in pre-school institutions in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Features of the practice of inclusive education for pre-school children have been determined on the basis of qualitative and quantitative methodology, content analysis and statistical analysis. The results indicate that there are differences in the inclusive education of pre-school children in these countries. Therefore, the practice of inclusive education in the Czech Republic is very different where children of pre-school age are highly involved in formal education, study in special groups to a greater extent and in completely separate educational institutions, and to a lesser extent in special pre-school institutions. Segregation in the Czech Republic is more intense, and therefore the level of inclusion is much lower. It was found that models of inclusion in pre-school education institutions in these countries can be defined as a model of full inclusion in Poland and Hungary (79.68% and 82.18%, respectively), partial inclusion in Slovakia and the Czech Republic (64.85% and 19.74% respectively). The Czech Republic differs significantly from Poland, Hungary and Slovakia in inclusive education for pre-school children.","Larysa, Zdanevych, V Oksana, Popovych Tetiana, Tsehelnyk M.

"ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to determine the anxiety levels experienced by students during the return to school and to evaluate them in terms of different variables.MethodThe sample of the study consists of 981 students aged 14-17 who live in Zonguldak and continue their high school education. Data collection tools of the research are; Personal Information Form and Beck Anxiety Inventory.ResultsAccording to the research findings, 60% of the participants experienced mild anxiety, 16.6% had moderate anxiety, and 23.4% had high anxiety. In the research; It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference between the anxiety levels of the participants by age, gender, vaccination, being hospitalized or deceased due to Covid-19 in their close relatives (relatives-neighbors-friends).ConclusionChildren and young people are the neglected victims of the pandemic due to the lack of symptoms. It is known that suspending face-to-face education as one of the measures taken during the pandemic adversely affects the mental health of students. However, the results of the research revealed that returning to face-to-face education also had negative effects on student anxiety. It can be stated that systematic screening studies, development of coping skills and implementation of school mental health programs can be beneficial in order to prevent this victimization.","Arici, Aylin Lotfi, Sayra Irmak, Hatice Selin Erkoc, Beyza Artan, Taner",,"Arici, A Lotfi, S Irmak, HS Erkoç, B Artan, T",349,"[Arici, Aylin; Lotfi, Sayra] Istanbul Medipol Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Social Work, Istanbul, Turkiye.

The World Health Organization warned that the pandemic, social isolation, and disinformation could raise stress and anxiety. The present study aims to study the psychological stress of COVID-19 on young learners with respect to gender, locality, type of family, profession and year of study. 430 respondents from different parts of Tamil Nadu responded to a questionnaire based on five dimensions (Mental Stress, Health Stress, Academic Stress, Financial Stress and Social Stress). The results reveal that there is no statistically significant variation in the psycho-logical stress of COVID-19 by gender, locality, type of family and profession among young learners. Female responders have endured tension, assault, and abuse due to the lockdown. Rural respondents felt more alone than their urban peers; young learners experienced the same level of psychological stress regardless of their family types.

"Virtual Reality (VR) is an immersive virtual environment generated through computer technology. VR teaching, by utilizing an immersive learning model, offers innovative learning methods for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education as well as programming education. This study developed a Drone Virtual Reality Teaching (DVRT) system aimed at beginners in drone operation and programming, with the goal of addressing the challenges in traditional drone and programming education, such as difficulty in engaging students and lack of practicality. Through the system's curriculum, students learn basic drone operation skills and advanced programming techniques. We conducted a course experiment primarily targeting undergraduate students who are beginners in drone operation. The test results showed that most students achieved scores above 4 out of 5, indicating that DVRT can effectively promote the development of users' comprehensive STEM literacy and computational thinking, thereby demonstrating the great potential of VR technology in STEM education. Through this innovative teaching method, students not only gain knowledge but also enjoy the fun of immersive learning.","Jin, Zean Bai, Yulong Song, Wei Yu, Qinghe Yue, Xiaoxin Jia, Xiang",104114,"Jin, Z Bai, YL Song, W Yu, QH Yue, XX Jia, X",,"[Jin, Zean; Bai, Yulong; Song, Wei; Yu, Qinghe; Yue, Xiaoxin; Jia, Xiang] Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China.",Northwest Normal University - China,,,,,2025-01-19,Virtual reality; STEM; Graphical programming; Drones,10.1016/j.cag.2024.104114,Article,,1873-7684,baiyulong@nwnu.edu.cn,,,"Gansu Provincial Special Research Project on Curriculum and Textbooks for Primary, Secondary, and Higher Education [GSJC-Z2024155]","This research was partially supported by the 2024 Gansu Provincial Special Research Project on Curriculum and Textbooks for Primary, Secondary, and Higher Education under project numbers GSJC-Z2024155.",L8E8J,EDUCATION; GAMES,,COMPUT GRAPH-UK,Comput.

"The aim of this article is to discuss and problematise issues related to conceptual approaches to differences among children in the world of school education. The article is based on results from a Swedish study on categorisation of schoolchildren's 'problems' from a historical perspective. Its central questions are: 'What concepts are used to formulate children's various educational needs, and how can these concepts be understood?' Supported by an ecological analysis model, complex situations in the categorisation and problem-solving process are clarified. Using terminology to refer to pupils' diverse abilities and needs involves aspects of categorising. An understanding of how this works may bring more profound knowledge of obstacles to children's learning. The categorisation process illustrates effects both at individual level and more generally. Categorisation may be regarded as a useful practice for understanding children's differences better, and thereby finding the best ways of responding to them. However, categorisation based on abilities and needs also adds a challenge to the important idea of inclusion. The article discusses categorisation as a basis for educational problem-solving and the implications of categorising children's varying abilities and experience of school education. The theoretical premises enhance understanding of the dynamic nature of terminology usage, and thus future prospects of meeting challenges that may arise, in schools.","Hellblom-Thibblin, Tina",,"Hellblom-Thibblin, T",1,"[Hellblom-Thibblin, Tina] Malardalen Univ, Sch Educ Culture & Commun, Div Special Needs Educ, Vasteras, Sweden.",Malardalen University,,,,,2025-01-19,Categorisation; categorisation process; diversity; ecological perspective; exclusion; inclusion; behavioural problems; neuropsychiatric disorders; interaction problems; identity process,10.1080/08856257.2017.1297570,Article,,1469-591X,tina.hellblom-thibblin@mdh.se,15,,Swedish Research Council [2011-5656],This work was supported by The Swedish Research Council [grant number 2011-5656].,GD5SL,INCLUSIVE EDUCATION; BEHAVIOR; STUDENTS; MAINSTREAM; IDENTITIES; DISORDERS; EXCLUSION; TEACHERS; ALBERTA; PUPILS,1,EUR J SPEC NEEDS EDU,Eur.

"The study of the consequences of school education has proved the need for reinforcement family interventions in school education and also the need to improve the model of family-school interaction (FSI). The family and the school are two complementary educational institutions. But the emergence of digital technologies and especially the critical situation caused by the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has paved the way for their further interaction. However, both the family and the school have faced serious changes in their educational tasks and functions, and have raised questions about the possibility of upgrading the FSI and possible changes in curriculum. The present study is qualitative and the data collection tool is in-depth interview. Participators in the study are 24 teachers and parents of 6-11-year-old male and female learners who are involved in virtual education. Findings showed that virtual education in social, educational, cost-related, skill-related, emotional, and communication settings has a great impact and has created opportunities and challenges. This study also showed that in promoting family-school interaction, educational opportunities were the most significant and cost-related challenges were more than others. In addition, in order to promote family-school interaction, policies and strategies need to be identified that help in the equitable distribution of learning activities between parents and teachers and improve the model of family-school interaction according to the limited capacities of digital technologies.","Alamolhoda, Jamileh",,"Alamolhoda, J",251,"[Alamolhoda, Jamileh] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Educ & Psychol Org, Tehran, Iran.",Shahid Beheshti University,,,,,2025-01-19,Digital education; Virtual education; Curriculum; Family; School; Family-school interaction,10.1007/s40688-021-00381-6,Article,,2161-1505,Alamolhodaj@Gmail.com,261,,,,MC1F4,,2,CONTEMP SCH PSYCHOL,Contemp.

"Challenges of a lack of formal technology-embeded teacher training, collaborative learning models, adequate technology know-how, and internet access are barriers to adopting technological-enabled teaching and learning STEM subjects in the African context. This study examined technology adoption for STEM in higher education while evaluating students' experiences with evidence and implications for less developed countries. The survey research design was adopted for the study. The study population was students in higher learning institutions in selected countries in the sub-Saharan African region using a multi-stage sampling procedure consisting of convenience and purposive sampling techniques. A self-developed questionnaire titled Technology Adoption for Teaching and Learning Questionnaire ""TATLQ"" premised on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model was used for data collection. The instrument had an overall reliability coefficient of 0.96. The collated data were analysed using descriptive of the median and a network chart to answer the research questions. In contrast, the inferential statistics of t-test and Analysis of Variance statistics were used to test the hypothesis generated for the study and implemented in the psych package of R programming language version 4.0.2 software. Findings revealed that students had a positive experience with online teaching and learning and concluded that technology adoption for STEM education online teaching and learning is feasible in sub-Sahara Africa, with the need for improvements in internet access and technical support on the basis for which recommendations were made.","Oladele, Jumoke Iyabode Ayanwale, Musa Adekunle Ndlovu, Mdutshekelwa",,"Oladele, JI Ayanwale, MA Ndlovu, M",237,"[Oladele, Jumoke Iyabode; Ayanwale, Musa Adekunle; Ndlovu, Mdutshekelwa] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Educ, Dept Sci & Technol Educ, Auckland Pk, ZA-2006 Gauteng, South Africa.",University of Johannesburg,,,,,2025-01-19,Higher education; online teaching and learning; STEM education; students? experiences; technology adoption,10.47836/pjst.31.1.15,Article,,,jumokeo@uj.ac.za; ayanwalea@uj.ac.za; mndlovu@uj.ac.za,256,,,,C7OE5,,1,PERTANIKA J SCI TECH,Pertanika J.

"Introduction: This article is the product of a classroom experiment developed by UNIMINUTO in the ninth-grade of the Educational Institution Simon Bolivar in ""La Nohora"" neighborhood of the Villavicencio - Colombia; this project was executed during 2017 and 2018. Problem: The problem is the low academic performance of students in mathematics, in addition to multiple possible adverse situations they face as a vulnerable population. Objective: The objective is to have a positive impact on the academic performance of the students. Methodology: In the development of the strategy, STEM education was used to support the learning of math; six sessions were carried out within the students' own classroom. The students solved challenges by programming robots. Results: Completing each challenge had an important attitudinal impact on the students; their perceived joy and satisfaction were an unexpected result. A previous knowledge test was carried out at the beginning; at the end of the sessions, a formative test was also performed. Afterwards, the results of both tests were compared to evidence improvements in the students' mathematical skills. Conclusions: It was possible to provide the target population with an alternative to understand issues mistakenly considered difficult and to propose important playful and didactic moments in cognitive development. Originality: This article shows an educational innovation that the team of researchers will continue to apply through new projects that allow financing the purchase of equipment and the logistics of the workshops. Limitations: Lack of strategic alliances that allow financing more meetings with students and the acquisition of more robots.","Alberto Cuellar-Guarnizo, Jairo Hernandez-Alvarez, Wilmer Antonio Gutierrez-Cardenas, Marco Dahiana Vega-Santofimio, Hayley",,"Cuéllar-Guarnizo, JA Hernández-Alvarez, W Gutiérrez-Cárdenas, MA Vega-Santofimio, HD",,"[Alberto Cuellar-Guarnizo, Jairo] Politecn Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid, Fac Ingn, Bello, Colombia.

"Addressing 21st century challenges, professionals competent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will be indispensable. A stronger individualisation of STEM learning environments is commonly considered a means to help more students develop the envisioned level of competence. However, research suggests that career aspirations are not only dependent on competence but also on STEM identity development. STEM identity development is relevant for all students, but particularly relevant for already under-served students. Focusing solely on the development of competence in the individualisation of STEM learning environments is not only harming the goal of educating enough professionals competent in STEM, but may also create further discrimination against those students already under-served in STEM education. One contemporary approach for individualisation of learning environments is learning analytics. Learning analytics are known to come with the threat of the reproduction of historically grown inequalities. In the research field, responsible learning analytics were introduced to navigate between potentials and threats. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that expands responsible learning analytics by the context of STEM identity development with a focus on under-served students. We discuss two major issues and deduce six suppositions aimed at guiding the use of as well as future research on the use of learning analytics in STEM education. Our work can inform political decision making on how to regulate learning analytics in STEM education to help providing a fair chance for the development of STEM identities for all students.","Grimm, Adrian Steegh, Anneke Colakoglu, Jasmin Kubsch, Marcus Neumann, Knut",1082748,"Grimm, A Steegh, A Çolakoglu, J Kubsch, M Neumann, K",,"[Grimm, Adrian; Steegh, Anneke; Colakoglu, Jasmin; Kubsch, Marcus; Neumann, Knut] IPN Leibniz Inst Sci & Math Educ, Kiel, Germany.",Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur die Padagogik der Naturwissenschaften und Mathematik an der Universitat Kiel (IPN),,,,,2025-01-19,STEM identity; under-served students; responsible learning analytics; equity; bias; intersectionality,10.3389/feduc.2022.1082748,Article,,2504-284X,grimm@leibniz-ipn.de,,,Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01JD2008],This work was supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

"Web-based learning environments (WBLE) are widely adopted in the context of higher education. Comparatively, little is known about how they are used in high school mathematics curricula. Therefore, this systematic review investigates how WBLEs are applied in high school education and which outcomes this instructional approach has resulted in up to now. 14 related journal publications on high school WBLE are identified and analysed in terms of their WBLE activities, student achievement, attitude, and challenges encountered. The findings suggest that several activities are used in WBLE. WBLE application in high school mathematics education produced a neutral or positive effect on student achievement when compared to traditional classroom-based learning. Students' attitudes toward WBLE approach are varied. WBLE implementation challenges are classified as student-associated, faculty-associated, and operational. We proposed seven possible solutions to address these challenges based on previous studies. Also, recommendations for future research are discussed.","Kissi, Philip Siaw Nat, Muesser Idowu, Adeleye",,"Kissi, PS Nat, M Idowu, A",1061,"[Kissi, Philip Siaw] Univ Educ, HRM Dept, Sch Business, Winneba, Ghana.

"Interdisciplinary learning requires students to integrate knowledge and methods from different disciplines, prompting advanced skills development and knowledge construction by connecting diverse subjects. Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rich information base and abilities to track learning and provide personalized support, has the potential to support interdisciplinary teaching and learning. Previous literature reviews either focus on AI in education in general or Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, leaving the research trends, challenges, and opportunities of AI for interdisciplinary learning insufficiently examined. To address this gap, this systematic review synthesizes research on AI for interdisciplinary learning published from 2010 to 2023. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a meticulous analysis of 71 publications. We found that AI for interdisciplinary learning was primarily manifested in four forms: models, robots, systems, and conceptual frameworks, with varied frequencies. We summarized the diverse roles of AI in interdisciplinary learning: it not only enhances interactive, immersive, and personalized learning experiences, but also supports institutional and administrative services. AI has holistic influences on students and plays a significant role in supporting teachers' assessment and professional development. Moreover, the review uncovered the imbalance and limitations of current studies and suggested future research trends. This review provides a thorough understanding of AI for interdisciplinary learning, offering valuable insights for future research, teaching, and technological designs.","Cai, Chang Zhu, Gaoxia Ma, Min",,"Cai, C Zhu, GX Ma, M",,"[Cai, Chang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med LKC Med, Singapore, Singapore.

"Electronic textbooks (e-Textbooks) are digitized forms of textbooks which are envisioned to replace existing paper-based textbooks. After intensive literature review, together with interview results, our study has figured out four major IT-based challenges associated with e-Textbooks in its pursuit to replace the traditional textbooks, namely standardizing format of content, improving service reliability, improving quality and accuracy of content, and improving readability. This paper also provides an extensive review on how these challenges have been approached using existing e-Textbook solutions, such as N-Screen services, cloud computing, open market place, P2P between devices and HTML5. For each solution, we develop a usage scenario in which users apply the aforementioned technologies to interact with e-Textbooks and share contents among themselves. This article aims to provide a strong foundation for further investigations into the development and distribution of e-Textbooks for eventual successful adoption of e-Textbooks in school education.","Lee, Heejeong Jasmine Yau, Kok-Lim Alvin",,"Lee, HJ Yau, KLA",40,"[Lee, Heejeong Jasmine] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.

"Some people in Japanese society have been classified as 'invisible' because they could not complete their compulsory elementary school education and have failed to assimilate into mainstream society. The 2010 Japan Census identified about 1.3 people per thousand over 15 years old who had not graduated from elementary school. However, the circumstances that prevented them from completing their compulsory elementary school education and their current challenges in accessing lifelong learning have yet to be researched. In an attempt to investigate these two issues, quasi-experimental panel data analysis with count data was applied to determine the characteristics of invisible people using the Japan census data disaggregated by the district for all residents and decomposed of environmental and war factors, thus unravelling the geographic anomaly in the national data. Estimation results showed that their features can be explained by three multi-level layers: 1) an explanation due to personal conditions: being in a state of poverty, 2) an explanation created by differences in nationality, and 3) identification from environmental factors, such as geographical isolation and the Battle of Okinawa. We can identify specific features of how to deliver lifelong learning to people with information barriers.","Usui, Takehiro Chikasada, Mitsuko Aloiau, Edwin",,"Usui, T Chikasada, M Aloiau, E",127,"[Usui, Takehiro; Chikasada, Mitsuko; Aloiau, Edwin] Soka Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.

"The need to support science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning in secondary education is reflected in the ongoing investigation of innovative pedagogical practices, including game-based learning (GBL). Using an analysis of scholarly publications based on word co-occurrence, this study aimed to identify the main research themes addressed in the past decade by the scholarly community on game-based teaching and learning solutions in the context of STEM education in secondary schools, their evolution over time, and the key issues addressed in recent years. After a systematic selection, the titles and abstracts of the publications were collected in a text corpus and analyzed using T-LAB software version 7.2.1.4 (2022). A preliminary visual exploration of the keywords was performed to obtain an overall view of the issues addressed by the research. Specificity analysis was then applied to identify, for each subset of the corpus identified by the years of publication, the evolution of themes reflected in a change in the frequency of lemma use. Finally, to explore the most recent topics, the main thematic clusters of publications in the last three years were identified (thematic analysis of elementary contexts). The results suggest some changes in the issues addressed over the past decade, such as a shift in focus from the specific technologies and competitive elements of games to understanding how GBL can support engagement, motivation, and understanding of complex scientific concepts. The five key thematic clusters identified (""Experience"", ""Application"", ""Validation"", ""Emotion"", and ""Programming"") also indicate a stronger emphasis by the latest publications on the experiential and emotional components of learning, the need for empirical studies, and the integration of computational thinking and coding into GBL. Overall, this study indicates that GBL has the potential to become an integrated component of STEM education, evolving with pedagogical and technological innovations.","Fante, Chiara Ravicchio, Fabrizio Manganello, Flavio",662,"Fante, C Ravicchio, F Manganello, F",,"[Fante, Chiara; Ravicchio, Fabrizio; Manganello, Flavio] CNR, Inst Educ Technol, I-16049 Genoa, Italy.",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Tecnologie Didattiche (ITD-CNR),,,,,2025-01-19,game-based learning; secondary STEM education; research trends; textual analysis,10.3390/educsci14060662,Article,,2227-7102,chiara.fante@itd.cnr.it; fabrizio.ravicchio@itd.cnr.it; manganello@itd.cnr.it,,,Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy [B59B22000180001],"The study presented in this paper has been carried out with the support of the DI5CISproject, co-funded by the Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy (Project Number: B59B22000180001).",WP2Y5,COGNITIVE LOAD; 21ST-CENTURY SKILLS; LEARNING APPROACH; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; PERFORMANCE; VIDEO; ACHIEVEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; MOTIVATION,6,EDUC SCI,Educ.

The findings revealed six structural challenges faced by young religious women in the STEM path: 1) difficulties in managing a healthy balance between family and career; 2) alienation; 3) disapprobative environmental reaction in the religious community; 4) lack of female religious role models; 5) Jewish religious traditions as a limiting factor when competing with secular counterparts; and 6) the paradox of the supportive environment in all-female religious secondary schools. According to the women's narratives, the religiosity component in some challenges is more salient and pronounced than gender.","Lissitsa, Sabina Ben-Zamara, Rinat-Tamar Chachashvili-Bolotin, Svetlana",102709,"Lissitsa, S Ben-Zamara, RT Chachashvili-Bolotin, S",,"[Lissitsa, Sabina; Ben-Zamara, Rinat-Tamar] Ariel Univ, Sch Commun, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel.

"The perception of parenthood is observed through parental attitudes and beliefs about children and parenting. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between how parents perceive their own parental competencies (parental self-efficacy, parental internal and external locus of control) and social support of close people (friends, family and significant others), according to sex and parental education. The study involved 194 subjects, 148 mothers and 46 fathers. A weak connection was found between parental self-efficacy and social support. Parents who perceive to be more self-effective estimate that they also receive more support from their environment and vice versa. No statistically significant difference was found in the perception of parental competence and the perception of social support with regard to sex, but the difference was found in parental self-efficiency and the external locus of control depending on the level of education. Parents with lower and high school education perceive themselves to be more self-effective in the parental role and have a larger external locus of control, compared to academically educated parents. In conclusion, it is important to recognize parents with low self-efficacy, i.e. lower parental competence, as well as those who estimate that they have little support from their environment, and to direct them to the possibilities of increasing parental competence.","Fotez, Lidija Brajsa-Zganec, Andreja",,"Fotez, L Brajsa-Zganec, A",1033,"[Fotez, Lidija] Kindergarten Latica Klenovnik, Klenovnik, Croatia.

"Purpose - The paper innovates on the existing literature by assessing the gender gap in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) tertiary education enrolment and career choice in a small country setting and by extending on Master and Meltzoff (2016) theoretical framework to provide a holistic explanation of the gender disparity through a mix of personal, environmental and behavioural factors. The study first probes into the existence of potential gender disparity in STEM tertiary enrolment in Mauritius. Second, in contrast with existing studies where selective factors are used to measure the gender gap in STEM education, this paper investigates into a combination of personal, environmental and behavioural factors that may influence participation in STEM education and career. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses a survey of 209 undergraduates enroled in the main public university and investigates into the existence of a gender gap in STEM tertiary education enrolment and the reasons behind this disparity. Consistent with the theoretical model, the empirical analysis also investigates into the work environment (which cannot be measured from the survey), via semi-structured interviews of 15 women in STEM professions. Findings - The logit regression results first reveal the existence of a gender disparity in the choice of STEM-related degrees. The probability of a female student to enrol in a STEM degree is lower than that of a male student, after controlling for all the personal, environmental and behavioural factors. The most important set of reasons influencing the student's STEM degree choice are self-efficacy and the student's academic performance in STEM subjects at secondary school level. The findings also demonstrate that young women are relatively more likely to choose STEM degrees than their male counterparts when they are supported by their family, school and teachers. There is further evidence of lower participation of women in STEM professions as well as significant challenges which women in STEM careers face compared to their male colleagues. Originality/value - This study adopts a holistic framework to assess the factors that hinder women's participation in STEM tertiary education and career in Mauritius.","Tandrayen-Ragoobur, Verena Gokulsing, Deepa",,"Tandrayen-Ragoobur, V Gokulsing, D",1021,"[Tandrayen-Ragoobur, Verena] Univ Mauritius, Dept Econ & Stat, Reduit, Mauritius.

"Simple Summary The rapid increase in technology in recent years has created the need to apply different methods in education. Teaching lessons with technology-based activities rather than the traditional teaching method is an obligation for teachers. For this reason, teachers need resources whose validity and reliability are tested that they can use in their lessons. In this study, a part of the technology content resource that teachers need for a biology lesson is presented. While preparing the course contents, a STEM approach including science, engineering, mathematics and technology disciplines was used. A significant increase was found in the ability of the students to whom the developed activities were applied to establish cause and effect relationships. According to this result, it can be said that Arduino-supported STEM education improves students' abilities to establish cause and effect relationships. Considering that generations that have grown up in the 21st-century have grown alongside technology, it is thought that integrating technology into lessons helps students learn the subject. This study aims to develop five STEM activities for the lesson of the human body systems by integrating the coding-based Arduino into STEM education. The activities were implemented to 6th-grade students for seven weeks and the effects on students' skills of establishing a cause-effect relationship. The study method was pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental design, and the cause-effect relationship scale and semi-structured view form were used as data collection tools. As a result of the study, a significant difference was found between the Arduino-supported STEM activities developed and the students' skills of establishing a cause-effect relationship. The students who received the Arduino-supported STEM education found the course to be entertaining and educational, and the future goals of these students were affected. In order to bring individuals who love their profession into the future, Arduino-supported STEM education should be applied and expanded in other branches and class levels.","Gorgulu Ari, Asli Meco, Gulsum",506,"Ari, AG Meço, G",,"[Gorgulu Ari, Asli; Meco, Gulsum] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Sci Educ, TR-34220 Istanbul, Turkey.",Yildiz Technical University,,,,,2025-01-19,Arduino; 21st century skills; thinking skills; computational thinking; critical thinking; STEM,10.3390/biology10060506,Article,,2079-7737,agorgulu@yildiz.edu.tr; gulsummeco@gmail.com,,,,,SX7KY,LEARNING ANALYTICS; CHALLENGES,6,BIOLOGY-BASEL,Biology-Basel,English,,35,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted","GORGULU ARI, ASLI/0000-0002-6034-3684; , Gulsum Meco/0000-0003-4069-5970","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",JUN,17,BASEL,34200184,,J,MDPI,2021,"GÖRGÜLÜ ARI, Aslı/ABA-6651-2020","Meço, G (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Sci Educ, TR-34220 Istanbul, Turkey.",Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,,,BIOLOGY-BASEL,,,6,A New Application in Biology Education: Development and Implementation of Arduino-Supported STEM Activities,9,53,WOS:000665380200001,10,,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),6
"In 2007, the World Health Organization, together with United Nations and international organization as well as experts, met to draw upon existing evidence and practical experience from regions, countries and individual schools in promoting health through schools. The goal of the meeting was to identify current and emerging global factors affecting schools, and to help them respond more effectively to health, education and development opportunities. At the meeting, a Statement was developed describing effective approaches and strategies that can be adopted by schools to promote health, education and development. Five key challenges were identified. These described the need to continue building evidence and capturing practical experience in school health; the importance of improving implementation processes to ensure optimal transfer of evidence into practice; the need to alleviating social and economic disadvantage in access to and successful completion of school education; the opportunity to harness media influences for positive benefit, and the continuing challenge to improve partnerships among different sectors and organizations. The participants also identified a range of actions needed to respond to these challenges, highlighting the need for action by local school communities, governments and international organizations to invest in quality education, and to increase participation of children and young people in school education. This paper describes the rationale for and process of the meeting and the development of the Statement and outlines some of the most immediate efforts made to implement the actions identified in the Statement. It also suggests further joint actions required for the implementation of the Statement.","Tang, Kwok-Cho Nutbeam, Don Aldinger, Carmen St Leger, Lawrence Bundy, Donald Hoffmann, Anna Maria Yankah, Ekua McCall, Doug Buijs, Goof Arnaout, Said Morales, Sofialeticia Robinson, Faye Torranin, Charuaypon Drake, Lesley Abolfotouh, Mostafa Whitman, Cheryl Vince Meresman, Sergio Odete, Cossa Joukhadar, Abdul-Halim Avison, Claire Wright, Cream Huerta, Franscico Munodawafa, Davison Nyamwaya, David Heckert, Karen",,"Tang, KC Nutbeam, D Aldinger, C St Leger, L Bundy, D Hoffmann, AM Yankah, E McCall, D Buijs, G Arnaout, S Morales, S Robinson, F Torranin, C Drake, L Abolfotouh, M Whitman, CV Meresman, S Odete, C Joukhadar, AH Avison, C Wright, C Huerta, F Munodawafa, D Nyamwaya, D Heckert, K",68,"[Nutbeam, Don] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

"Information and communication, technology (ICT) has become a necessary tool in education post-COVID-19 pandemic. However, integrating ICT into teaching and learning has been a daunting challenge in many developing countries, such as Uganda. This qualitative case study investigated the challenges that primary school teachers face in implementing ICT in teaching science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects in Uganda. The study found various challenges divided into three categories: infrastructure and internet connectivity; individual factors and administrative support; and curriculum and learner support materials. A significant obstacle was the lack of computer access, internet connectivity, and ICT textbooks. Additionally, teachers lacked the ICT skills necessary to integrate technology into their teaching methods, and administrative support was insufficient. The identified challenges in this study will require a multi-pronged approach that includes increasing investment in infrastructure, providing training and support to teachers, and developing relevant and appropriate ICT curriculum materials. In conclusion, this study highlights the challenges that primary school teachers face in implementing ICT in teaching STEM subjects in Uganda. By addressing the identified challenges, policymakers and stakeholders can take steps towards improving ICT integration in primary school education and bridging the digital divide in Uganda and other developing countries.","Kibirige, Israel",382,"Kibirige, I",,"[Kibirige, Israel] Univ Limpopo, Dept Math Sci & Technol Educ, P Bag X1106, ZA-0727 Sovenga, South Africa.",University of Limpopo,,,,,2025-01-19,challenges; digital divide; ICT integration; primary schools; STEM subjects; post-COVID-19,10.3390/educsci13040382,Article,,2227-7102,israel.kibirige@ul.ac.za,,,,,F5ZH6,PERFORMANCE,4,EDUC SCI,Educ.

"The article analyzes the role of school education in the context of the origin and subsequent evolution of French political republicanism, which was implemented in the form of ""France-republic"" or ""nation-republic"". As noted in the article, the need to achieve the homogeneity of the nation at the political-right level in the conditions of the heterogeneous French society in reality brought to the fore the topic of the formation of a republican political culture cemented by the principle of secularism. One of the most significant areas of application of the principle of secularism, laid down in the foundation of the French republican tradition, was school education. Through various cases, both historical and modern, the article defines the French specifics of the use of the school as a tool for asserting republican values and maintaining the cultural homogeneity of the republican polity. Noting that since the 1789 French Revolution, the issue of school education in France has been politicized, the author of the article demonstrates how this problem has become an important element of sociopolitical discussions in the format of speeches, reports and journalistic texts (for example, the projects of Ch. M. de Talleyrand, N. de Condorcet, E. J. Sieyes, etc.), and in the practical plane was formalized in various constitutional and legislative acts. It is emphasized that the top of the legislative process in this area was the "" laws of J. Ferry"", who is rightly considered the architect and creator of the French ""republican school"". Thus, the foundations were laid and the most important principles of the organization of education - universal, secular, free of charge, etc. - on French soil were formulated, as well as the tasks of the education system as an important sphere of state structure designed to form and reinforce the public virtues of French citizens. Within the framework of the republican tradition, the organization of school education is declared an obligation and duty of the state to its citizens. Special attention is paid to the new draft bill ""Reinforcing Republican Principles"", which was initiated in 2020 by French President Emmanuel Macron with the aim of reconstructing the ""republican order"" and protecting one of the most important republican values - the principle of secularism. It is concluded that, at the present stage in France, one can observe the reactualization of the tradition of protecting republican values through school. The school system is used as a tool of ""reinforcing republican principles"", but is undergoing reform to adapt to the new challenges of national identity.","Poliakova, Natalia, V",,"Poliakova, NV",139,"[Poliakova, Natalia, V] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",Saint Petersburg State University,,,,,2025-01-19,France; republic; republicanism; education; school; secularism; general obligation,10.17223/1998863X/62/12,Article,,2311-2395,belnata70@yandex.ru,152,,,,WM9GP,,,VESTN TOMSK U-FILOS,Vestn.

"Recent research advocating the educational value of engaging primary students in authentic integrated STEM inquiry projects also identifies challenges for teachers aspiring to high-quality student-learning experiences. Teachers require support to integrate disciplines, prioritise processes and reasoning over curriculum content, and increase student autonomy in purposeful STEM projects. Within the context of a year-long professional learning program in Australia, an innovative tri-level approach to skill-building for teachers and their students has been developed. The three levels of 'STEM Skills', 'Design Process' and 'Integrated STEM Projects' are intended to successively escalate demands on time, resources and pedagogical change while promoting the development of the dispositions and skills needed to engage in sustained inquiry projects. The teacher participants (n = 11) came from five schools who had just concluded the STEM Academy professional learning program. Semi-structured interviews guided teacher reflection. Data analysis combined inductive and deductive processes to thematize meaning and revealed ways in which the tri-level approach to STEM education supported the development of STEM integration practices. The findings suggest the efficacy of the tri-level approach and its potential value beyond the context in which it was developed.","Way, Jennifer Preston, Christine Cartwright, Katherin",827,"Way, J Preston, C Cartwright, K",,"[Way, Jennifer; Preston, Christine; Cartwright, Katherin] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Educ & Social Work, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",University of Sydney,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; professional development; teacher perceptions; interview,10.3390/educsci12110827,Article,,2227-7102,jennifer.way@sydney.edu.au,,,,,6V2GS,SCIENCE,11,EDUC SCI,Educ.

"A decline in European students' interest in STEM subjects, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic's disruption of education, has raised concerns about the continent's future workforce. To address this challenge, this study investigates the efficacy of the BIG GAME project methodology, a cooperative story-driven digital game approach designed to engage secondary students in collaborative environmental problem-solving. Implemented across Romania, Italy, Estonia, and Finland, this six-month study employed a mixed-methods design involving 62 teachers and 239 students in ten distinct game missions focused on environmental challenges. The quantitative results indicated significant improvements in students' transversal skills (teamwork, communication, and critical thinking), as reported by over 75% of teachers. The qualitative data emphasised the value of structured peer review in developing students' reflective practices. This research underscores the importance of teacher facilitation in game-based learning and problem-based simulations and highlights the potential of such methodologies to boost student engagement and environmental awareness. These findings suggest that the BIG GAME project approach could be a valuable tool for revitalising STEM education and cultivating future-ready citizens.","Tramonti, Michela Dochshanov, Alden Meirzhanovich Fiadotau, Mikhail Gronlund, Mikko Callaghan, Peadar Ailincai, Alina Marini, Barbara Joenvaara, Sari Maurer, Liina Delle Donne, Elisabetta",893,"Tramonti, M Dochshanov, AM Fiadotau, M Grönlund, M Callaghan, P Ailincai, A Marini, B Joenvaara, S Maurer, L Delle Donne, E",,"[Tramonti, Michela; Dochshanov, Alden Meirzhanovich] European Training & Res Key Cooperat Business EU T, I-04019 Terracina, LT, Italy.

"Design thinking has become increasingly important in the context of the current movement toward integrated STEM education. Allied teaching practices often take the form of project-based learning, which represents a major shift in the teaching and learning process and poses challenges for many teachers during implementation. Many professional development programmes for STEM teachers focus on the development of teacher beliefs and content or technological knowledge. Teachers may not have enough opportunities to gain sufficient knowledge of how to foster students' intrinsic motivation for project-based learning. The teacher-support dimensions - autonomy, structure and involvement - distinguished in self-determination theory (SDT) can foster student motivation, and the teaching experience can allow for feedback and reflection. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate how to design a PD programme consisting of a workshop and actual teaching experience as a way of using SDT-based design thinking in teaching STEM project-based learning. Specifically, the study comprised two interventions designed to examine how teacher/student learning is affected by workshops alone and actual teaching experience, respectively. The participants were 60 teachers and 358 secondary school students. The findings revealed that it is beneficial for teachers to apply what they learned from workshops in classroom teaching and that SDT-based design thinking benefits students more than non-SDT-based design thinking. Hence, this study suggests that professional development should occur over a sustained period, enhance teacher capacity to support students' needs, and offer multiple opportunities for feedback and reflection. Consequently, a model of pedagogical design thinking for professional development programmes is proposed.","Chiu, Thomas K. F. Chai, Ching Sing Williams, P.

"United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4, namely Quality Education, has highlighted major challenges for all nations to ensure inclusive and equitable quality access to education, facilities for children and young adults. The SDG4 is even more important for developing nations as receiving proper education or vocational training, especially in science and technology, means a foundational step in improving other aspects of their citizens' lives. However, the extant scientific literature about STEM education still lacks focus on developing countries, even more in rural areas. Using a dataset of 4967 observations of junior high school students from a rural area in a transition economy, the article employed the Bayesian approach to identify the association between gender, socio-economic status, and students' STEM academic achievements, which were measured by the average score of their most recent 45-minute standard school tests in STEM subjects: Maths, Physics, Chemistry (and Biology where applicable). The results reported that gender had little association with STEM academic achievements. However, female students appeared to have achieved better results than their male counterparts when their parents have non-manual jobs. Families with better economic status, parents with a high level of education, or non-manual jobs were associated with better study results. Also, students with zero or more than two siblings were correlated with lower study results than those with only one sibling. These results provided important implications for policymakers to provide women with opportunities for better education and maintain family size so the parents can provide their resources to each child equally.",Manh-Toan Ho Viet-Phuong La Minh-Hoang Nguyen Thanh-Hang Pham Thu-Trang Vuong Ha-My Vuong Hung-Hiep Pham Anh-Duc Hoang Quan-Hoang Vuong,105650,"Ho, MT La, VP Nguyen, MH Pham, TH Vuong, TT Vuong, HM Pham, HH Hoang, AD Vuong, QH",,"[Manh-Toan Ho; Viet-Phuong La; Minh-Hoang Nguyen; Quan-Hoang Vuong] Phenikaa Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Social Res, Yen Nghia Ward, Hanoi 100803, Vietnam.

"New interactive technologies in terms of smart mobile devices and accompanied applications (apps) attract an increasing attention in the field of preschool and early-primary education. This has risen a great amount of academic literature, and numerous implementation initiatives. Despite this widespread interest, successful integration of interactive technologies in preschool and early-primary education still faces unresolved issues and challenges. This paper refers mostly to smart mobile devices and their accompanied mobile applications (apps) at the device/platform level. Robotics, Mathematics, STEM and Literacy are discussed below, since these are the fields found to provide most opportunities in early childhood, especially promising to cultivate interests early in computing. The ultimate objective is to present a greater comprehension of the influence of new technologies on young children's learning procedure and its potential for early childhood education. The study ends up with a general analysis of the research findings and a short proposal for the extension of the under-study subject as well.","Dorouka, Pandora Papadakis, Stamatis Kalogiannakis, Michail",,"Dorouka, P Papadakis, S Kalogiannakis, M",255,"[Dorouka, Pandora; Papadakis, Stamatis; Kalogiannakis, Michail] Univ Crete, Dept Presch Educ, Rethimnon, Crete, Greece.

"This article explores ways to promote symmetrical dialogue among knowledge-practices of artisanal fishing communities, primary education teachers, and academic researchers in the state of Bahia, Brazil. We describe multiple engagements in an inter-and transdisciplinary project that integrates research, educational, and conservation activities in two communities living in an estuarine ecosystem. Most community members dedicate their efforts to fishing activities, harboring wide knowledge about local biocultural diversity. The project promotes collaborative inclusion of local expertise and knowledge in school activities, while also striving for the inhabitants' inclusion in the planning of protected areas. The collaboration aims at symmetrical dialogues between researchers and communities that support self-determination in local school education and biodiversity conservation. Challenges to such symmetrization, including disagreements and tensions among diverse actors, not only appear in encounters of local and academic knowledge, but also within the interdisciplinary project involving natural sciences, social sciences, and philosophy.","Bollettin, Paride Ludwig, David El-Hani, Charbel N.",,"Bollettin, P Ludwig, D El-Hani, CN",47,"[Bollettin, Paride] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Anthropol, Brno, Czech Republic.

"With the rapid development of information technology, artificial intelligence has demonstrated great potential in promoting educational transformation. In November 2022, the release of the artificial intelligence product ChatGPT attracted widespread attention, particularly in the field of education, sparking heated discussions among scholars. As a language processing tool, ChatGPT can not only answer user questions but also complete user-specified tasks and even continuously optimize task performance. However, while possessing powerful features, ChatGPT also has some shortcomings that need improvement, such as the accuracy of answering questions, data pollution issues, ethical and safety concerns, and the risk of knowledge plagiarism. In the process of promoting school education reform, the application of ChatGPT brings both opportunities and challenges. Moreover, ChatGPT's emergence offers teachers an opportunity to reflect on their professional value and sets higher demands for them.","Yu, Hao",e24289,"Yu, H",,"[Yu, Hao] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Fac Educ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",Shaanxi Normal University,,,,,2025-01-19,ChatGPT; Artificial intelligence; Teacher education; Teacher literacy; Educational transformation,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e24289,Review,JAN 2024,2405-8440,yh13213986381@163.com,,,"General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

"This paper sets out to discuss the methodological challenges of ethnographic research in institutions of early childhood and school education in English and Finnish settings. The paper is based on two ethnographic projects. Both projects ask how transition to school is institutionalised in a comparative perspective. The authors focus on the shared experiences they made during the field research in a foreign country. Drawing on experiences during field-entry and the first phases of field research, the two ethnographic researchers point out how their expectations of ""strangeness"" were irritated, and how they were actively supported by the teachers and pupils to understand what is going on. The article comes to the conclusion that the task of making the familiar strange remains a central challenge - even if the research is done in unfamiliar educational systems.","Huf, Christina Panagiotopoulou, Argyro",,"Huf, C Panagiotopoulou, A",264,"[Huf, Christina] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fachbereich Erziehungswissensch, Inst Padagog Elementar & Primarstufe, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.

"The analyzes carried out in this article come from studies and reflections that recognize the relevance of Paulo Freire Pedagogy, especially in the current context, in which disputes over conceptions of education are fiercer. We aim to reflect on the challenges faced by the Brazilian public school facing these times of ""neoconservative wave"" in the country. The methodological path is a bibliographical review of Freire's works, which are still current, with potential for analysis on the contemporary educational context. Through the literature review, we reiterate that Paulo Freire, concrete and theoretical authority in the history of Brazilian education, continues to contribute to the reaffirmation of the importance of a democratic Popular Education. His works and experiences in the field of education reveal potential for theoretical and methodological analyzes, reflections and propositions about the current educational context.","Paulo, Fernanda dos Santos Tessaro, Monica Ceron Trevisol, Maria Teresa",e14606,"Paulo, FD Tessaro, M Trevisol, MTC",,"[Paulo, Fernanda dos Santos] Univ Oeste Santa Catarina UNOESC, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

"Background/Objective Medical student geriatrics education using community-based volunteer older persons, known as a Senior Mentor Program (SMP), began decades ago. Though these programs have been described and evaluated against curriculum objectives, the full breadth of students' learning from SMPs has not been reported. Methods We conducted a qualitative study using content analysis of reflections of Year 2 medical students submitted during a single visit home-based SMP. Written reflections of 102 randomly selected students from 2016-2018 were inductively coded and grouped into themes. Older persons from the SMP site assisted in coding and quotation selection. Results We discerned six themes from the evaluation of student reflections: student insight, interview and exam, social community, challenges with aging, strengths (responses to challenges), and physical infrastructure. Conclusion A single home visit with older adults enables pre-clinical medical students to learn about multiple positive aspects of aging.","Ratner, Edward R. Kilaberia, Tina R.

"This paper shows the ways in which 'resilience' operates with adolescents whose lives have been marked by a significant health condition. It is based on a qualitative study that followed 31 adolescents, dealing with chronic illness, across 3 years of their lives. The study placed the adolescents at the centre of the research process, allowing them to articulate their experiences and perceptions of themselves, both visually and verbally. A complex portrayal of risk and resilience emerged as the young people spoke about the challenges they faced. Described by many around them as 'resilient', the research found that one key component of this was the participants' desire to live lives as 'normal' as possible even when faced with management challenges associated with their health conditions. Even though many described ongoing disconnection with school, education still played an important role in their life goal setting.","Ferguson, Peter Walker, Hannah",,"Ferguson, P Walker, H",227,"[Ferguson, Peter] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Grad Sch Educ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.

"This paper presents Indonesian preservice teachers' experiences in designing a Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics-Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (STEM-TPACK) learning website. The framework of TPACK was expanded to include all STEM subjects for the synthesis of the theoretical/design framework. The STEM-TPACK framework is further epitomized as a replicable website to support preservice teachers in designing STEM lesson activities. The framework is also employed to examine preservice teachers' efficacies and experiences in learning how to design the learning website. Thirty-seven second- and third-year Indonesian preservice teachers from science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering backgrounds formed interdisciplinary groups to design the STEM-TPACK website based on the current secondary school curricula. Data were collected from TPACK-STEM questionnaires, interviews, reflective journals, and observation. The preservice teachers' efficacy for their STEM-TPACK developed significantly, with large effect sizes, after they co-designed the websites. The results also indicate that the preservice teachers faced challenges in communicating their discipline-based content knowledge when developing the STEM projects. Contextualizing and connecting their content knowledge with real-world design challenges was also difficult for them. Consequently, the preservice teachers realized that teaching is a complex matter, especially when they need to integrate the different disciplines for STEM education. However, this was viewed in a positive light for professional development. This study implies that preservice teachers may benefit from learning by design, employing the TPACK framework in the social setting of interdisciplinary STEM communities.","Chai, Ching Sing Rahmawati, Yuli Jong, Morris Siu-Yung",9050,"Chai, CS Rahmawati, Y Jong, MSY",,"[Chai, Ching Sing; Jong, Morris Siu-Yung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

"The global pandemic and climate change have led to unprecedented environmental, social, and economic challenges with interdisciplinary STEM foundations. Even as STEM learning has never been more important, very few pre-college programs prepare students to address these challenges by emphasizing socio-scientific issue (SSI) problem solving and the engineering design of solutions to address local phenomena. The paper discusses the design and evaluation of a pre-college, SSI curricular unit where students expand their learning by creating solutions to increase biodiversity within local urban neighborhoods. The learning approach, which we call eco-solutioning, builds from current vision and policy documents in STEM education emphasizing phenomenon-centric instructional materials, science investigations, and engineering design. The paper outlines design principles for creating an eco-solutioning instructional unit that guides young students to: collect and analyze data on local organisms, use an engineering design approach to craft solutions to increase local biodiversity, and present their solutions to local city planners and community members. Two cycles of research studies evaluated student learning using paired t-tests. Results demonstrated significant pre-post learning outcomes in both research cycles. A third research cycle in the form of a summer extension program supported students as they implemented their local solutions. Conclusions highlight design principles for the successful creation of SSI curricular units centered on local environmental issues of interest to students, teachers, and stakeholders.","Songer, Nancy Butler Recalde, Guillermo D.

"This study aimed to clarify teachers' perspectives regarding the future of schools by identifying the impact of COVID-19 on school education through a survey of teachers' attitudes. Our research covered an overview of the impact of COVID-19 as of autumn 2021 and teachers' attitudes towards school redesign in the same period, and we investigated whether a relationship exists between the two, through an exploratory analysis. Our results revealed some interesting differences in attitudes among different teacher demographics based on school type, years of teaching experience, and geographical contexts, among other variables. Further, a significant finding was regarding the ambiguous views among teachers observed about returning to the previous school orientation (pre-COVID-19) or adopting the new school orientation (post-COVID-19). We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it provides some important insights on specific factors affecting teachers' attitudes as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is essential to plan and implement the pedagogical changes necessary to address the challenges experienced by teachers during the pandemic. Our research also explores and proposes recommendations regarding the important topic of future readiness in education.","Takizawa, Jun Ogawa, Mitsuhiro Yoshida, Nariakira Ando, Kazuhisa Kawamoto, Yoshitaro Takeshima, Chiaki",,"Takizawa, J Ogawa, M Yoshida, N Ando, K Kawamoto, Y Takeshima, C",706,"[Takizawa, Jun; Ogawa, Mitsuhiro; Yoshida, Nariakira; Ando, Kazuhisa; Kawamoto, Yoshitaro; Takeshima, Chiaki] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Higashihiroshima, Japan.",Hiroshima University,,,,,2025-01-19,COVID-19; future readiness; Japan; school redesign; teacher attitudes,10.1080/02188791.2023.2231647,Article,,1742-6855,takizawa@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,742,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22H00080] Funding Source: KAKEN,,R4HX7,STRESS,3,ASIA PAC J EDUC,Asia Pac.

"We propose Edgar Morin's notion of transdisciplinarity as a complementary educational perspective for preparing business school students in addressing the complex global socio-economic and environmental challenges that our planet has been facing for some time. Morin's notion of transdisciplinarity spans various disciplines, both within disciplines and beyond individual disciplines. Morin's transdisciplinary approach is inquiry driven and presents a systemic/humanistic vision and form of awareness that challenges habitually dualistic and simplistic thinking. Morin's transdisciplinarity is based on a dialogical and translogical principle that extends classical and rigid logic and that helps students to explore and unify concepts of a simultaneous complementary and contradictory nature. Confronting students with different modes of thinking, imagining and feeling can help them to develop greater self-awareness, critical reflection, and creativity; with various frames of reference; and with an openness toward and confidence in engaging in changes needed to address global challenges in a sustainable and responsible way.","Groschl, Stefan Gabaldon, Patricia",,"Gröschl, S Gabaldon, P",185,"[Groschl, Stefan] ESSEC Business Sch, Fac Management, Cergy Pontoise, France.

"This article focuses on the experiences of alumni adolescents on the contribution of a Youth Opportunities Programme, a non-profit after-school education programme presented in Namibia. A qualitative descriptive design was used to provide insight into the contribution of this programme. Five focus groups were conducted with 32 participants. The transcribed data were analysed by means of thematic analysis. The rich descriptions of the experiences of alumni adolescents indicated learning, personal and relational experiences as well as challenges. The learning experiences included the transfer of academic knowledge and skills that assisted them to deal with advanced opportunities, and the provision of resources. They were able to socialise with friends and form personal relationships with teachers, serving as emotional support. The challenges they encountered while attending the programme on a full-time basis included high expectations in terms of time management, attendance and behaviour. These challenges proved to be exhausting at times.","Wilson, Lizane Gouws, Leanna Nienaber, Alida W.",,"Wilson, L Gouws, L Nienaber, AW",,"[Wilson, Lizane] North West Univ, Ctr Child Youth & Family Studies, Potchefstroom, South Africa.

"Aim. In this study, the challenges encountered during the introduction of religious education in Turkey are examined within the scope of their intended solutions. Methods. In this study, challenges encountered in the implementation of religious education in Turkey are being discussed in a descriptive manner. Literature scanning and interpretation methods, one of the qualitative research methods, were used in the study. Results. Religious education in Turkey is both maintained within the formal education system and the non-formal education system. Formal education is provided in public schools run by the Ministry of National Education [MNE]. Primary, secondary and high school education is compulsory for all students. There are Imam Hatip Schools that were opened to provide religious education at secondary and high school level. There are also two hours of compulsory religious education per week in other schools. Non-formal religious education is provided only by the Presidency of Religious Affairs [PRA]. This training is given to people of all ages. For this purpose, the PRA opens several courses. Conclusions. In this study, challenges encountered related to religious education in Turkey are being discussed in two main areas: Challenges in formal education are examined under seven subtitles. Challenges in non-formal education are examined under eight subtitles. Originality. This study is an original study in terms of addressing the challenges in formal and non-formal religious education together. In addition, the possibility of making a collective examination of challenges related to religious educationin Turkey would he valuable to the reader.","Demircioglu, Aytekin",,"Demircioglu, A",474,"[Demircioglu, Aytekin] Kastamonu Univ Sci & Literature, Fac Philosophy Dept, TR-37150 Kastamonu, Turkey.",,,,,,2025-01-19,education; religious education; education in Turkey; religious education in Turkey; religious education challenges,,Article,,2081-1640,demircioglu.aytekin@gmail.com,489,,,,NN9UN,,2,J EDUC CULT SOC,J.

"BackgroundAlthough research has advanced the field of oncologic geriatrics with survivors to assess their cancer-related needs and devise patient-centered interventions, most of that research has excluded rural populations. This study aimed to understand the survivorship challenges and recommendations in the perspective of rural older adults.MethodsThis was a qualitative study that explored the survivorship challenges and recommendations of rural older adults who have completed curative intent chemotherapy for a solid tumor malignancy in the 12 months prior to enrollment in the present study.ResultsTwenty-seven older adult survivors from rural areas completed open-ended semi-structured interviews. The mean age was 73.4 (SD = 5.0). Most participants were non-Hispanic White (96.3%), female (59.3%), married (63.0%), and had up to a high school education (51.9%). Rural older survivors reported a general lack of awareness of survivorship care plans, communication challenges with healthcare team, transportation challenges, financial toxicity, psychological challenges, and diet and physical challenges. Rural older survivors recommend the provision of nutritional advice referral to exercise programs, and social support groups and for their healthcare providers to discuss their survivorship plan with them.ConclusionsAlthough study participants reported similar survivorship challenges as urban older adult survivors, additional challenges reported regarding transportation and consideration of farm animals have not been previously reported. Heightened awareness of the survivorship needs of rural older adults may result in better survivorship care for this population.","Arana-Chicas, Evelyn Prisco, Laura M.

"The medium of education (MoE) globally sparks controversy over the ideal medium-mother tongue, target language, or bilingual/multilingual policies. In Bangladesh, diverse MoE options (Bangla medium, English medium, and English version) fuel debates among stakeholders. Amidst this noise, systemic problems are often overlooked, diverting attention from critical educational issues. Drawing on qualitative data from parents' comments in a public Facebook forum in Bangladesh, this article explores factors influencing MoE choices and how this discourse distracts from pressing social and educational concerns. Findings indicate that the government promotes various MoEs for diverse political interests, often failing to provide inclusive and equitable quality education for all. The article also highlights that different factors distract parents from selecting a suitable MoE for their children's education. Social media, with parents' anecdotal comments, often misleads others. Additionally, parents may impose their aspirations on children, ignoring their interests and abilities. This neglect of students' basic needs while promoting diverse MoE exacerbates inequality and social injustice. The article advocates for an equitable, inclusive education system that offers quality education regardless of socioeconomic background, or MoE.","Roshid, Mohammod Moninoor Le Ha, Phan",,"Roshid, MM Le Ha, P",,"[Roshid, Mohammod Moninoor] Univ Dhaka, Inst Educ & Res, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh.

"Open educational resources, or OER, are teaching materials that reside in the public domain and are available under an open license. While the creation of high -quality materials and cyberinfrastructure to share these resources is important, OER are much more than static resource repositories. Vibrant OER communities function as collaboration hubs and often include librarians, instructional technologists, instructors, education researchers, funders, open -source software developers, and college administrators. Together, these individuals work as a community to respond to changes in the education landscape, support student learning impacts both in terms of cost savings and student retention, and solve issues related to broadly sharing open resources on the web. This essay provides general information about OER, describes communities developing OER for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education, and presents insights about sustainability challenges. The sustainability challenges are organized according to multiple dimensions: cultural and social, economic and financial, and technological and environmental. In addition, OER provide important opportunities to address and promote social justice and open and accessible education philosophies. Knowing more about the OER landscape, sustainability challenges, and educational justice opportunities can help instructors use and contribute to this growing movement to reshape the landscape of undergraduate education.","Eaton, Carrie Diaz Bonner, Kaitlin Cangialosi, Karen Dewsbury, Bryan Diamond-Stanic, Maggie Douma, Jason Smith, Michelle Taylor, Robin Wojdak, Jeremy Wilfong, Krystie",es4,"Eaton, CD Bonner, K Cangialosi, K Dewsbury, B Diamond-Stanic, M Douma, J Smith, M Taylor, R Wojdak, J Wilfong, K",,"[Eaton, Carrie Diaz; Diamond-Stanic, Maggie] Bates Coll, Digital & Computat Studies, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA.

"Background Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in Asian universities struggles to integrate Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA) due to large classes and student reluctance. While ChatGPT offers solutions, its conventional use may hinder independent critical thinking. Objectives This study introduces PA-GPT, using ChatGPT as a ""virtual peer"" in peer assessments to promote active learning and enhance knowledge, higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), and attitudes-the core of KSA in STEM. Methods A randomised controlled trial involved 61 first-year engineering students (43 males, 18 females) from a university in Southern Taiwan enrolled in ""Network Embedded Systems and Applications."" Participants, all with prior ChatGPT experience but no programming background, were purposively sampled. They were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 31) using PA-GPT or the control group (n = 30) using traditional ChatGPT. Over 8 weeks, data were collected using pre- and post-tests: a knowledge construction test (20 items, alpha = 0.85); a HOTS scale (alpha = 0.78-0.83) measuring critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity; and the S-STEM questionnaire (alpha >0.80) assessing attitudes towards STEM subjects and 21st-century learning. ANCOVA analysed the data, controlling for pre-test scores, and Levene's test checked homogeneity of variances. Results and Conclusions ANCOVA results showed that PA-GPT significantly outperformed traditional ChatGPT in enhancing knowledge construction (F = 9.89, p = 0.002), critical thinking (F = 37.00, p < 0.001), problem-solving (F = 9.40, p = 0.003), creativity (F = 7.22, p = 0.009), and attitudes towards mathematics (F = 25.52, p < 0.001), engineering/technology (F = 16.06, p < 0.001), and 21st-century learning (F = 26.38, p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that PA-GPT effectively addresses challenges in student engagement and HOTS development in STEM education by simulating peer interactions. Peer Assessment with ChatGPT (PA-GPT) promotes active learning and self-reflection, potentially revolutionising AI-assisted education in large class settings. This study provides pioneering evidence for the effectiveness of AI-driven peer assessment in enhancing comprehensive STEM competencies, offering a promising direction for future educational technology integration.","Wu, Ting-Ting Lee, Hsin-Yu Chen, Pei-Hua Lin, Chia-Ju Huang, Yueh-Min",,"Wu, TT Lee, HY Chen, PH Lin, CJ Huang, YM",,"[Wu, Ting-Ting; Lee, Hsin-Yu] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Technol & Vocat Educ, Yunlin, Taiwan.

"United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 emphasises the need to 'reduce inequality within and among countries.' In line with this goal, this study focuses on the educational experiences of five rural migrant children from an urban village in China. Using the concept of hidden curriculum (HC), the study explores whether these children have encountered social exclusion in their schools. Through interviews and observations, the study shows that the HC is not easily discernible but subtly influences students, teachers, and parents, resulting in a certain degree of social exclusion within various educational facets. Reducing inequalities through education presents significant challenges, requiring sustained efforts.","Li, Luyao Curdt-Christiansen, Xiao Lan",,"Li, LY Curdt-Christiansen, XL",,"[Li, Luyao] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Foreign Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"STEM education interrelates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, ensuring that all interrelated contents are taught in coherence instead of in isolation. This promotes collaboration, critical thinking, and active engagement among students. The study ascertained the factors that compromise the implementation of STEM practices in the Bono East Region of Ghana to gain a moderately broad and deep understanding, allowing for a critical analysis of outcomes. It adopted a descriptive survey design to explore information concerning STEM education as it existed from May to October 2022. The study was carried out in Public Senior High and Vocational-Technical Schools in the Bono East Region of Ghana. The schools were split into STEM-related schools and non-STEM-related schools using a stratified sampling technique. Ten STEM-related schools were chosen using a purposive sampling method. 271 instructors from the departments of Science, Mathematics, and Information Communication Technology made up the study's population. A survey using a well-structured closed-ended questionnaire was administered online and the response obtained was transformed into frequencies and percentages in tabular forms using Microsoft Excel version 2016 (Microsoft, USA). Software Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 (IBM, USA) was used to perform a chi-square test to determine differences between responses obtained at the test significance of 5%. The study revealed that the general implementation of STEM practices throughout the studied Senior High Schools was below the mark. Inadequate STEM teaching-learning materials, limited certified STEM teachers, lack of STEMdedicated infrastructure, inadequate professional development opportunities, absence of STEM documented standards and curriculum, limited access to technology, and limited time for teaching STEM-related subjects were some of the major factors contributing to the unsuccessful implementation of STEM practices in studied Public Senior High and Vocational-Technical Schools. Be that as it may, the study, therefore, recommended some measures including comprehensive STEM policies, adoptions of systematic STEM framework, and rigorous curriculum overhaul to be considered by the various stakeholders of education to realize the aspirations of inclusive STEM education.","Bardoe, Dennis Hayford, Daniel Bio, Robert Bagngmen Gyabeng, Jones",e20416,"Bardoe, D Hayford, D Bio, RB Gyabeng, J",,"[Bardoe, Dennis; Bio, Robert Bagngmen] Akenten Appiah Menka Univ Skill Training & Entrepr, Dept Publ Hlth Educ, Mampong, Ghana.

"This article examines the connection between sport and the First World War. It challenges the conventional wisdom that the athleticism associated with a public school education made a significant contribution to the British war effort. Additionally it argues that athleticism had a negligible influence on elementary school pupils who comprised the bulk of the military forces. It also suggests that while army authorities eventually accepted that sport had a positive role to play and made it a compulsory element of military training, it also existed as an escape from hostilities rather than just preparation for them.","Vamplew, Wray",,"Vamplew, W",2297,"Univ Stirling, Sch Sport, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",University of Stirling,,,,,2025-01-19,myth; research method; war; public school sport; military sport,10.1080/09523367.2014.907598,Article,,1743-9035,wray.vamplew@stir.ac.uk,2312,,,,AW5UE,MODERN PENTATHLON; FOOTBALL; 1ST-WORLD-WAR; ATHLETICISM,18,INT J HIST SPORT,Int.

This study included interviews with 29 student participants (the majority of whom were African American or Latina/o/x(1)) and 19 faculty mentors or staff program coordinators drawn from five Bridge-to-the-Doctorate STEM programs. Participants described two key challenges: (a) othering by non-bridge peers and (b) intense scrutiny by faculty and staff. Findings show that the presence of Bridge programs alone does not disrupt traditional norms and practices in STEM fields.

"The web offers rich learning resources, including technology education. With the advocate of hands-on learning and STEM education, many web videos teach users how to use technological tools to create STEM artifacts and acquire related science knowledge. These videos were adopted by teachers in their classroom and followed closely as pro-claimed technology education. As web credibility is a challenge and how students approach the topics to develop systematic knowledge are crucial, this study proposed a learning model to address these challenges. The model was embedded into a teacher training to have teachers self-experience these challenges. Participating teachers were expected to construct their pedagogical knowledge inductively, and their responses to the proposed learning were collected. With the participation of 27 in-service teachers, the results demonstrated teachers' recognition and support of the proposed model. However, their beliefs and concerns regarding its implementation generated uncertainty.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has launched school digital transformation with educational technologies implemented in classrooms worldwide. Teachers and learners have faced the challenges of adaptation to a new mode - digitally-based distance teaching and learning. In this regard, a question arises, whether schools have adapted successfully to new digitally-based distance learning or failed. Therefore, the research is focused on revealing the trends in schools' digital adaptation and transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. The research issue is solved due to a combination of various approaches, e.g. a qualitative content analysis of documents published online in 2020-2021 and conducting surveys and interviews of students at Ukrainian schools from December 2020 to February 2021. These approaches make it possible to reveal positive and negative trends in school digital transformation at macro-and micro levels from the perspective of pandemic-related measures on international and national levels, as well as students' perception of emergency distance learning. The research presents the ranks of countries in line with the accessibility and affordability of EdTech having been implemented in schools in crisis. Moreover, the research discusses the following issues: the COVID-19 pandemic impact on schools and school-related measures, EdTech implementation in classroom and schools' digital transition, digital divide and inequity in education, generation gap, learning loss and achievement gap, teacher's creativity and methodology shift. The collected data supports theoretical insights about trends in school education during the pandemic. The principal findings of the research are that the emergency integration of information technology in school education has changed the traditional way of teaching and learning worldwide. EdTech implementation encourages teachers to provide creative teaching and develop novel approaches to meet Net generation students' needs in a virtual educational environment. The research results can contribute to policymaking and strategy development of further school digital transformation in times of crisis.","Mospan, Natalia V.

"Introduction. Accelerating human progress is a result of the growing role of innovations. This requires the development of an innovative person as an effective actor of their implementation and support. Primary, and secondary education is very important factor for this. The New Ukrainian School (NUS) reform that has been being implemented since 2016 shall adequately meet current challenges and trends. roblem Statement. To this end, it is very important to identify the key intra-system and contextual factors influencing the quality of school education, first of all in reading, mathematics, and natural sciences, in terms of the development of an innovative person. Purpose. The purpose of this research is to determine the endogenous (internal) and exogenous (external) factors that effectively influence the educational quality, in order to optimize the NUS implementation in the present-day conditions. Materials and Methods. Multifactor system analysis (in particular statistical, correlation, and comparative techniques) of big global databases on human development, international assessment of the quality of primary and basic secondary education, development of world research and university spheres and features of the NUS implementation in Ukraine. Results. The probable global connections between the quality of school education and the factors of internal educational and external contextual impact on the educational quality have been identified. Among the considered nine factors effecting the quality of student education in reading, mathematics, and science, the most influential (resonant) and stable are the endogenous ones, namely, the mean years of schooling, and the share of R&D expenditure in GDP, with the latter having a greater impact. The recommendations for improving the efficiency of the NUS have been given. Conclusions. The effectiveness of school education reform, in particular, NUS, may be raised by taking into account the deterministic effect of endogenous and exogenous factors on the quality of education.","Kremen, V.

"Conceptually grounded curricular materials in the context of professional development programs facilitate teachers' adoption of new pedagogies. Even though science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professional development opportunities for early grade level teachers continue to receive attention, one existing challenge is to support teachers further in implementing well-defined integrated STEM curricula. The earlySTEM program supports K-4 teachers with the systematically developed earlySTEM curriculum, its associated curricular materials, and year-long mentoring. The program was implemented in 26 schools. This mid-evaluation investigated teacher perceptions of the earlySTEM program with a focus on contributions and challenges. A total of 134 teachers from the 26 schools responded to a survey with open-ended questions. Survey data were analyzed using a descriptive approach. The findings indicated that the teachers had positive experiences with the earlySTEM program. The results revealed that the earlySTEM program is perceived to have contributed to (a) teachers' STEM teaching skills and STEM conceptualizations and (b) students' skills development and awareness on the connection of the curriculum content to real-world problems. The results also document the perceived challenge in implementing the earlySTEM curriculum: need for more classroom time. The conclusions offer insights for similar program designs.","Mesutoglu, Canan Corlu, Mehmet Sencer",,"Mesutoglu, C Corlu, MS",145,"[Mesutoglu, Canan] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Educ, Eindhoven, Netherlands.

"The research examined the interplay between institutional logics in a multi-sectoral initiative. Taking a longitudinal approach, we tracked the first three years of an initiative that aimed to reduce social inequality by promoting science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in Israel. We observed how the paradoxical dynamics between multiple logics unfolded over time, following the alternating dominance of business, civil and state actors. Results showed the initiative oscillated between a civil society logic, seeing STEM as a 'springboard' for equal opportunities and social change, and a market logic, seeing STEM as a 'pipeline' towards a technological workforce and economic profit. The state logic influenced this oscillation by converging with one of the two other logics, affecting both the working processes and the social impact of the initiative. We contribute to paradox theory by developing a process model of the paradoxical dynamics between multiple institutional logics in multi-sectoral initiatives. We identify three main mechanisms that drive this process: power shifts, logic divergence/convergence and turning points. We suggest implications for the management of complex organizational environments.","Ben David, Yael Rubel-Lifschitz, Tammy",,"Ben David, Y Rubel-Lifschitz, T",2031,"[Ben David, Yael] Reichman Univ Herzliya IDC, Herzliyya, Israel.

"Scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. Still, enrolment rates in STEM degrees are low in many European countries and consequently there is a lack of adequately educated workforce in industries. We believe that this can be mainly attributed to pedagogical issues, such as the lack of engaging hands-on activities utilized for science and math education in middle and high schools. In this paper, we report our work in the SciChallenge European project, which aims at increasing the interest of pre-university students in STEM disciplines, through its distinguishing feature, the systematic use of social media for providing and evaluation of the student-generated content. A social media-aware contest and platform were thus developed and tested in a pan-European contest that attracted > 700 participants. The statistical analysis and results revealed that the platform and contest positively influenced participants STEM learning and motivation, while only the gender factor for the younger study group appeared to affect the outcomes (confidence level -p < .05).","Achilleos, Achilleas P.

"STEM has successfully introduced an interdisciplinary education model that can be used for training students to develop skillsets for the 21st century. STEM Education for Sustainability (STEM4S) expands the scope of education to meet rapidly changing global challenges, such as climate change and SDGs by the United Nations, which require the multidisciplinary curriculum to be integrated into STEM. Design-based tasks play a significant role in STEM education by promoting students' critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. While STEM successfully employs design, design education currently conducts subjective procedures and lacks the framework for adopting the critical-thinking process. Therefore, design education can develop students' cognitive skills by reflecting on STEM learning experiences. This study articulates the framework for design education by investigating problem-based and project-based learning and the double-diamond diagram for innovation. The goal of this study was to apply these observations and formulate the framework for STEM4S. This study examined the framework adopted at the National Taiwan Normal University in the Department of Design, with qualitative analysis of participants and quantitative analysis of questionnaire results. Finally, the researchers discuss the research questions and future applications of this framework.","Chan, Ming-Ni Nagatomo, Daisuke",312,"Chan, MN Nagatomo, D",,"[Chan, Ming-Ni] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Coll Design, PhD Program Design, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.

"COVID-19 posed formidable challenges to the teaching and learning of subjects with abstract concepts such as Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The study explored how STEM teachers transformed their pedagogical practices as an integral part of the transition to online teaching and learning in response to COVID-19 and further examined the effectiveness of online teaching and learning. The study adopted an exploratory descriptive survey design and involved purposively selected STEM teachers from schools operating under the auspices of the Association of Muslim Schools. The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework underpinned the study. Quantitative data was collected through the administration of a Likert scale instrument. Data was analysed using inferential and descriptive statistics. Findings revealed that COVID-19 essentially compelled teachers to make a transition to online teaching and learning resulting in a concomitant profound impact on their pedagogical practices. Teachers provided various perspectives on the key modalities adopted to navigate online teaching and learning on virtual platforms in an attempt to ensure sustainable, equitable and inclusive teaching and learning. Implications for broadening educational pathways to STEM education through online teaching and learning on virtual platforms and sustainable teacher professional development on technology integration in teaching and learning are discussed.","Dhurumraj, Thasmai Ramaila, Sam Raban, Ferhana Ashruf, Ahmed",,"Dhurumraj, T Ramaila, S Raban, F Ashruf, A",1055,"[Dhurumraj, Thasmai; Ramaila, Sam; Raban, Ferhana] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Educ, Dept Sci & Technol Educ SCITECHED, Auckland Pk Kingsway Campus, Johannesburg, South Africa.

"A number of tools exist to guide the monitoring and evaluation of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and outreach programmes. Fewer tools exist for evaluating astronomy outreach programmes. In this paper we try to overcome this limitation by presenting a monitoring and evaluation framework developed for the International Astronomical Union's Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD). The mandate of the OAD is to stimulate sustainable development at an international level and to expand astronomy education and outreach globally. The broad assumptions of this programme are that astronomy has the potential to contribute to human development by means of the transferable nature of its science discoveries, as well as its potential to activate feelings of wonderment, inspiration and awareness of the universe. As a result, the programme potentially embodies a far broader mix of outcomes than conventionally considered in STEM evaluation approaches. Towards this aim, we operationalise our monitoring and evaluation approach by first outlining programme theories for three key OAD programmes: a programme for universities and research, another one for schools, and one for public outreach. We then identify outcomes, indicators and measures for each one of these programmes. We conclude with suggestions for evaluating the global impact of astronomy for development.","Chapman, Sarah Catala, Laure Mauduit, Jean-Christophe Govender, Kevin Louw-Potgieter, Joha",,"Chapman, S Catala, L Mauduit, JC Govender, K Louw-Potgieter, J",59,"[Chapman, Sarah; Louw-Potgieter, Joha] Univ Cape Town, Sch Management Studies, Inst Monitoring & Evaluat, Sect Organisat Psychol, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.

"Studies on integrated STEM education and the integration of engineering practices into the instruction of science have called for the need to better understand the similarities, differences and interrelations between science and engineering, as well the naive views often associated with them. The current study contributes to this scholarly work through a systematic examination of the ways in which scientists and engineers are stereotypically described in jokes. An iterative content analysis of 68 different jokes about scientists and engineers was conducted, complemented by quantitative analysis of variants on these jokes (N = 1022), which examined the distribution of stereotypical attributes found across protagonists' (N = 1449) identities, and the distribution of the professional identity of the protagonists (scientist, engineer, other) across gender. The analysis yielded three thematic clusters of stereotypical attributes: (1) approach to tasks, problems and challenges, (2) awareness of, dealing with, and causing errors and imprecision, and (3) personality and social positioning. While the findings highlight some similarities between the stereotypical descriptions of scientists and engineers in jokes, each cluster has categories that capture specific differences between the stereotypical attributes associated with scientists as compared to engineers. In addition, an underlying perception of engineering as a masculine occupation emerged. The implications for science and STEM education are discussed.","Keren, Lior Kapon, Shulamit",,"Keren, L Kapon, S",617,"[Keren, Lior; Kapon, Shulamit] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, Haifa, Israel.",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,,,,,2025-01-19,Humor; Stereotypes; Nature of science; Nature of engineering,10.1007/s11191-022-00364-w,Article,JUL 2022,1573-1901,skapon@technion.ac.il,634,,,,F8MV6,SCIENCE; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; TEACHERS; STUDENTS; FEMALE; STEM,3,SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS,Sci.

"The remarkable upsurge in the attention for STEM education globally has inspired many countries including Malaysia to formulate STEM education policies to reform the existing segmented teaching of the four STEM subjects towards integrated teaching. One of the Malaysian government's initiatives include establishing a framework as a guide for teachers to practise STEM teaching. This exploratory, mixed methods study aimed to explore Malaysian science and mathematics teachers' perceptions to practise STEM teaching and develop a questionnaire to measure factors that explain their teaching practices. The interview findings identified teachers' knowledge of interdisciplinary and related pedagogical strategies, challenges encountered in STEM teaching practices, and teachers' self-efficacy beliefs to perform STEM teaching as factors that explain STEM teaching practices. Following that, a 33-item questionnaire was developed based on the qualitative findings. The results of exploratory factor analysis produced four distinct factors echoing the qualitative findings with 29 items, which were then validated using confirmatory composite analysis (CCA). CCA results in retaining all four factors and removing six items with lower loading values. Thus, the final version of the questionnaire consists of 23 items. The findings of this study were expected to benefit STEM advocates and educators globally. Additionally, the developed questionnaire would allow collective measurement of the factors that explain STEM teaching practices.","Karpudewan, Mageswary Krishnan, Pavitra Ali, Mohd Norawi Yoon Fah, Lay",e0268509,"Karpudewan, M Krishnan, P Ali, MN Yoon Fah, L",,"[Karpudewan, Mageswary; Krishnan, Pavitra; Ali, Mohd Norawi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Educ Studies Penang, Gelugor, Penang, Malaysia.

"School-based growing spaces support student engagement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning through authentic agricultural pursuits. We conducted a survey of Nebraska schools to characterize existing school-based growing spaces and to identify challenges limiting garden-based STEM learning. Our findings confirm the use of school-based growing spaces for kindergarten through 12th-grade STEM instruction, especially in the sciences. Opportunities for technology and engineering experiences are currently limited, and additional professional development support is needed to broaden garden-based STEM learning efforts. Our findings are relevant to current and future Extension efforts supporting school gardens, especially in rural agricultural communities.","Ingram, Erin Keshwani, Jenny",v58-6rb4,"Ingram, E Keshwani, J",,"[Ingram, Erin] Univ Nebraska, Inst Agr & Nat Resources Sci Literacy Initiat, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.

"BackgroundThe 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is characterised by a changing pattern of overlapping intellectual, physical, and mental disabilities along the course of one's life. However, the impact of overlapping disorders (multimorbidity) on educational challenges remains unclear. MethodA survey was conducted with 88 caregivers of individuals with 22q11DS. A quantitative analysis of educational challenges and support needs divided into age groups (7-12, 13-15, 16-18, and 19 years and over) and a qualitative analysis of the free-text items in the questionnaire was conducted. ResultsCaregivers were more interested in comprehensive developmental support when their children were younger, and the emphasis shifted to concerns regarding environments that matched individual characteristics at older ages. Furthermore, when there are multiple disabilities or disorders, support is concentrated on the more obvious disabilities, and the lack of support for the less superficially obvious disabilities associated with multiple difficulties, including mental health problems, can be a challenge for people with 22q11DS and their families. ConclusionsThis study suggests a need for increased focus on multimorbidity and associated disabilities in school education that are difficult to observe because of their mildness or borderline levels if present alone.","Tanaka, Miho Kanehara, Akiko Morishima, Ryo Kumakura, Yousuke Okouchi, Noriko Nakajima, Naomi Hamada, Junko Ogawa, Tomoko Tamune, Hidetaka Nakahara, Mutsumi Jinde, Seiichiro Kano, Yukiko Kasai, Kiyoto",,"Tanaka, M Kanehara, A Morishima, R Kumakura, Y Okouchi, N Nakajima, N Hamada, J Ogawa, T Tamune, H Nakahara, M Jinde, S Kano, Y Kasai, K",558,"[Tanaka, Miho; Kanehara, Akiko; Kumakura, Yousuke; Okouchi, Noriko; Nakajima, Naomi; Hamada, Junko; Jinde, Seiichiro; Kasai, Kiyoto] Univ Tokyo Hosp, Dept Neuropsychiat, Tokyo, Japan.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has provided medical students around the globe with unique challenges and opportunities. With formal medical school education and training interrupted, medical students sought innovative ways to contribute to their health-care systems and communities. Their responses could be organized into three categories: clinical (remote clinical care and triage, helping in COVID testing or treatment centers, and contact tracing), nonclinical (PPE acquisition, COVID-related policy and research, and supporting vulnerable groups in the community), and educational (creating materials to educate peers, the community, or community health workers). We present examples of responses developed by students from five countries: Brazil, Nepal, the Philippines, Rwanda, and the United States. We discuss the challenges, outcomes, and recommendations for each case. One critical opportunity for growth is strengthening international collaborations. We hope that these examples provide a framework for medical students to plan coordinated and effective responses to the next pandemic, and further medical student engagement in international collaboration.","Guragai, Mandeep Achanta, Aditya Gopez, Arianna Ysabelle Ong Niyotwambaza, Jonathan Cardoso, Luis Guilherme Estavillo, Nathaniel Ladera Dykstra, Michael",,"Guragai, M Achanta, A Gopez, AYO Niyotwambaza, J Cardoso, LG Estavillo, NL Dykstra, M",623,"[Guragai, Mandeep] Kathmandu Med Coll & Teaching Hosp, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.

"The work discusses the challenges for the legitimacy and recognition of Physical Education as a discipline capable of being part of a broad schooling process in contemporary times. It presents as a problem question: what are the prerogatives that the area of Physical Education can incorporate to be part of the schooling process that occurs in Basic Education? A text was constructed that uses the qualitative approach of science, with analysis and discussion of a specialized bibliography on the subject of Physical Education at school and its forms of legitimacy. It points out two major challenges for the Physical Education discipline, which are: 1) It is necessary to understand Physical Education as an area of knowledge and intervention with the body culture of movement that is imperative in the schooling process of young children and adults who attend school. school. 2) It is necessary to reflect on what it means and what the role of bodily practices in the subjects' school education.","Furtado, Renan Santos Ferreira Borges, Carlos Nazareno",,"Furtado, RS Borges, CNF",24,"[Furtado, Renan Santos] Univ Fed Para, Escola Aplicacao, Belem, Para, Brazil.

"Skills development is critical to South Africa's development. It has been argued that South Africa's twin post-Apartheid challenges, poverty and unemployment requires a level of skills development not undertaken before (RSA, 2008a; ANC, 2007). The creation of a separate ministry, the department of higher education and training (DHET), which has incorporated institutional entities from former Ministries of Education and Labour has engendered an expectation for the realisation of a co-ordinated and integrated post school education and training system. The establishment of this entity for the first time anticipates a coherent response to the education, training and skills development challenges faced by the country. The initial anticipation that this development will provide the basis for a coherent post-school education, training and skills development system, that is responsive to national development encapsulated by the notion of inclusive growth, have waned somewhat. In an attempt to link education and labour market more deliberately, it attempts to respond to both the education and labour market constituencies for greater synergy. The reality of success of a new institutional structure, within a wider structure embedded in the older pre-merged configuration, has proved more difficult than anticipated. The notion of 'policy as boundary object' is considered a critical missing element in the current repositioning and the changed political circumstances represent a golden moment to do things differently. This paper explores the current structural re-configuration, as it has, and is likely to, impact on the skills development provisioning in the country. In particular, it focuses on the impact of current developments on the delivery of intermediate level skills, and the likely role of the beleaguered public FET Colleges (FETCs) in this regard. Whilst it is accepted that the current development is new and unlikely to have a track record, the current context is critically evaluated in terms of the potentials and challenges identified against the empirical experience of ten years of skills development in the country.

"Purpose - Although active learning methodologies are recognized as an effective means to achieve expected educational demands, in practice, the teaching and learning processes are still widely characterized by traditional pedagogy aspects. As a result, teaching innovations in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education are carried out in isolation in specific disciplines, programs or departments. To addresses these challenges and to stimulate useful teaching innovations, this study aims to propose the capability maturity model to active learning (CMMAL) for assessing the maturity level of active learning methodologies in higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach - The CMMAL provides inputs for planning and decision-making, identifying variables such as the current state of teaching and learning processes, project management, team development, allocation of resources and infrastructure and the choice of evaluation and assessment methods. From the relevant literature, the primary aspects that impact on active learning were identified and incorporated into the structure of the model. Next, a survey was performed with 295 STEM professors and experts validating the scope of the model proposed. Findings - The findings demonstrated the contribution of the CMMAL mainly to (1) assess the maturity levels of active methodologies in higher education and (2) stimulate the institutionalization of active learning practices in HEIs to minimize some problems related to the dissemination of new teaching practices. Practical implications - The primary practical and academic contribution of our study is the proposition of an artifact with a scope compatible with the need of the HEIs for the implementation of active learning methodologies. This paper presents a different perspective of current literature in active learning in STEM education, introducing a model that contributes to open the dialogue with HEIs interested in better understand and improve the performance in student-centered pedagogy. Originality/value - The model also informs and leads to specific recommendations for HEIs seeking to enhance the performance of and alter the culture around active learning methodologies.","Garbin, Fernanda Gobbi de Boer ten Caten, Carla Schwengber Pacheco, Diego Augusto de Jesus",,"Garbin, FGD ten Caten, CS Pacheco, DAD",295,"[Garbin, Fernanda Gobbi de Boer] Fed Univ Pampa UNIPAMPA, Dept Prod Engn, Alegrete, Brazil.

"This study examines how science teachers experience integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) approaches into their teaching. In addition, it further examines the encountered challenges in this regard to shed light on STEM current practices within the context of United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study consists of two stages; the first involved collecting qualitative data using semi-structured interviews to explore three science teachers' perceptions and lived experiences having infused STEM into their regular teaching in cycle 2 for more than two years. Quantitative data were collected and analyzed in the second phase via the developed closed-ended questionnaire to examine teachers' perceptions across a larger sample regarding ""challenges encountered by teachers when implementing STEM teaching"". Research findings showed that science teachers generally have a positive attitude towards using STEM-based activities. In addition, data revealed that participants implement integrated STEM into their teaching frequently and regularly. Results also indicated teachers encounter challenges while implementing STEM: documentation, the vast curriculum content, and lack of time. Moreover, external challenges (i.e., the lack of supportive guidelines) rather than teachers' competency (i.e., having sufficient knowledge and skills for implementing STEM teaching) appeared to have the highest impending impact. Finally, we discuss findings and presented implications for teachers, educators, and policymakers.","Hamad, Sara Tairab, Hassan Wardat, Yousef Rabbani, Lutfieh AlArabi, Khaleel Yousif, Mohammed Abu-Al-Aish, Ahmad Stoica, George",3594,"Hamad, S Tairab, H Wardat, Y Rabbani, L AlArabi, K Yousif, M Abu-Al-Aish, A Stoica, G",,"[Hamad, Sara; Tairab, Hassan; Wardat, Yousef; Rabbani, Lutfieh; Yousif, Mohammed] United Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Educ, Al Ain 15551, U Arab Emirates.

"Particle physics is an exciting subject for high school students, and there have been various approaches on how to introduce the topic in the classroom. Feynman diagrams (FDs) are an often-used form of representation in particle physics and could play an important role in such an introduction. However, their potential educational value has not yet been investigated. To this end, we interviewed four experts in the field of particle physics education on the opportunities and challenges Feynman diagrams could pose for high school students. We analyzed their answers using a thematic analysis framework, categorizing them into five themes. The results of these interviews show that there are two challenges (FDs elicit and perpetuate inadequate conceptions about particle physics, and FDs can only be treated superficially in school) and three opportunities (FDs can link particle physics and other physics topics in high school education, FDs offer an opportunity for different particle physics topics to be taught, and FDs offer a connection to current research). The results of this expert interview study lead to several suggestions on how to design learning environments that incorporate Feynman diagrams.","Dahlkemper, Merten Nikolay Klein, Pascal Mueller, Andreas Schmeling, Sascha Marc Wiener, Jeff",,"Dahlkemper, MN Klein, P Müller, A Schmeling, SM Wiener, J",1331,"[Dahlkemper, Merten Nikolay; Schmeling, Sascha Marc; Wiener, Jeff] European Org Nucl Res CERN, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.

"COVID-19 resulted in disruptions that were both economic and social, significantly impacting the school education of tribal children. This study captures such experiences of the Konda Dora tribe in India by applying Mill's Sociological Imagination to the interviews of 43 children (6-13 years) and their families.

"Objective: To identify the potential subgroups of postoperative rehabilitation management self-efficacy in patients with lung cancer and explore the association between these subgroups and symptom burden. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 231 lung cancer patients who underwent surgery between May and August 2023. Latent profile analysis, univariate analysis, and disordered multinomial logistic regression were performed to explore postoperative rehabilitation management self-efficacy profiles and identify interindividual variability. ANOVA, LSD, and Tamhane's T2 method were used for multiple comparisons between symptom burden and self-efficacy subgroups. Results: The three subgroups of postoperative rehabilitation management self-efficacy identified included low level group (17.7%), medium level group (63.2%), and high level group (19.0%). Patients with junior high school education were more likely to be classified as medium level groups, and patients with higher levels of social support and better resilience were more likely to be classified as medium and high level groups. Symptom severity and symptom interference of lung cancer patients after surgery varied considerably among the three classes. In the lung cancer module, the high level group had fewer symptoms than the medium level group (P P < 0.05). Conclusions: Postoperative rehabilitation management self-efficacy has different classification features among patients with lung cancer. Educational background, resilience, and social support were the influencing factors of postoperative rehabilitation management self-efficacy. Lung cancer patients with higher self-efficacy in postoperative rehabilitation management showed fewer symptom burdens. Medical staff should actively pay attention to patients with low self-efficacy and provide precise interventions for patients with different subgroups.","Chen, Yujie Li, Xuting Chen, Tian Liu, Tian Lei, Qi Qiao, Jianfeng Ye, Man Huang, Lihua",100554,"Chen, YJ Li, XT Chen, T Liu, T Lei, Q Qiao, JF Ye, M Huang, LH",,"[Chen, Yujie; Li, Xuting; Liu, Tian; Lei, Qi; Qiao, Jianfeng; Ye, Man; Huang, Lihua] Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Clin Nursing Teaching & Res Sect, Changsha, Peoples R China.

"Background The study was initiated as a response to the growing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) experience in Egypt in terms of the growing number of schools, number of students admitted, and the effect of this experience on the overall education system in the country. Viewing teachers as the backbone of the STEM experience and teaching as a relational sociocultural practice (Biesta, G. & Stengel, B. (2016) AREA Handbook of research on teaching, 5th edition), this research explores the evolution of teachers' STEM identity during their professional journey in the Egyptian STEM education reform initiative. Aim The purpose of this study is to explore the dynamic dialogical interaction between the different factors impacting the development/evolution of the STEM teachers' identity. The study is guided by the following research questions: How did Egyptian STEM teachers' identity evolve over the course of the STEM experience in model STEM schools in Egypt? How did the political and structural characteristics of the STEM schools and teachers developing STEM identities interact and co-evolve? What do Egyptian STEM teachers identify as being important characteristics of STEM teachers Methodology A multiple holistic case study design was used to explore the research questions within the bounded context of an established Egyptian STEM school. Methods Data for this study were drawn from (1) semi-structured interviews conducted with seven teachers from an Egyptian STEM school and (2) document analysis of Ministry of Education decrees and the published reports of Education Consortium for the Advancement of STEM in Egypt. Results Using inductive and deductive data analysis, teachers were found to have undergone a deep transformative change process from a traditional teacher into teachers with a progressive mindset and student-centered classroom practices. The teachers developed strong conceptualizations of the STEM education, stressed the importance of collaboration, critical thinking, and motivation for teachers seeking to work in a STEM setting, and considered themselves moving towards established STEM teachers' identity. Conclusion This study concluded that STEM teachers' identity can be viewed as a dialogical, dynamic, and evolving process that results from the interaction of personal and professional traits within new educational experiences exemplified by the new and different experiences in their STEM schools. Despite several challenges, such as limited resources and influence from the bureaucracy and norms of the traditional education system, the teachers still persist in their professional growth and desire to impact the larger context of the Egyptian education system.","El Nagdi, Mohamed Roehrig, Gillian",41,"El Nagdi, M Roehrig, G",,"[El Nagdi, Mohamed; Roehrig, Gillian] Univ Minnesota, STEM Educ Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; STEM education in Egypt; Education change; Teacher identity; Case study,10.1186/s40594-020-00235-2,Article,,,elnag003@umn.edu,,,"Global Graduate Grant (G3), University of Minnesota, Twin Cities; Haugo Fellowship award","This research was partially funded by a Haugo Fellowship award and Global Graduate Grant (G3), University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.",MW4BT,SCIENCE,1,INT J STEM EDUC,Int.

"Active learning, represented by inquiry-based science education (IBSE) strategies, is considered essential for students to develop skills and knowledge to prepare for the challenges of the 21st century world. The success of IBSE, and the resulting development of inquiry skills in particular, can be enhanced by various factors. This study is focused on the synergetic effect of the implementation of IBSE through well-designed inquiry activities across STEM-related disciplines, enhanced by digital technologies and formative assessment tools, delivered by teachers educated in this field. The corresponding research based on a quasi-experimental design evaluated the effect on the development of inquiry skills that were identified before and after a period of consistent implementation of IBSE, using a written test of inquiry skills as the main research instrument. The research findings on the sample of 2307 upper secondary school students confirmed a low initial level of inquiry skills, however a statistically significant improvement in students' inquiry skills with medium size effect was identified. The detailed analysis shows the largest impact in the skill of determination of accuracy and statistically significant differences between genders without practical importance, however no difference was identified with regard to the number of inquiry activities undertaken.","Jeskova, Zuzana Luka, Stanislav Snajder, Lubomir Gunis, Jan Klein, Daniel Kires, Marian",686,"Jesková, Z Luká, S Snajder, L Gunis, J Klein, D Kires, M",,"[Jeskova, Zuzana; Luka, Stanislav; Snajder, Lubomir; Gunis, Jan; Klein, Daniel; Kires, Marian] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Sci, Srobarova 2, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice,,,,,2025-01-19,active learning; inquiry; inquiry-based science education; inquiry skills; STEM education,10.3390/educsci12100686,Article,,2227-7102,zuzana.jeskova@upjs.sk,,,National project IT Academy-Education for the 21st Century - European Social Fund [ITMS: 312011F057]; European Regional Development Fund; National Grant KEGA [004 UPJS-4/2020],"This research was funded by the National project IT Academy-Education for the 21st Century, ITMS: 312011F057, which is supported by the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund in the framework of the Operation Programme Human Resources.

"The full implementation of MOOCs in online education offers new opportunities for integrating multidisciplinary and comprehensive STEM education. It facilitates the alignment between online learning content and learning behaviors. However, it also presents new challenges, such as a high rate of STEM dropouts. Many learners struggle to establish effective learning behaviors and fail to complete the entire learning process. This study focuses on analyzing a vast amount of MOOCs learning behavior instances and proposes a knowledge graph-based analysis and prediction model that is centered around associated STEM concepts. The objective is to provide key insights for fostering sustainable and efficient learning behaviors. By constructing a heterogeneous information network, analyzing and learning from key concepts and their relationships by the improved graph convolution neural networks, and employing adaptive recommendations based on the course-concept matrix, it is possible to generate knowledge graphs from extensive learning behavior instances, both within single course and across multiple courses. This approach accurately captures learning behavior patterns and provides guidance for effective learning paths. The data analysis process and predictive results demonstrate that the knowledge graph can effectively guide learning behaviors and enhance learning outcomes. This research offers technical support and a decision-making foundation for optimizing interdisciplinary learning process within MOOCs for STEM education. It showcases strong innovation and practicality.","Xia, Xiaona Qi, Wanxue",,"Xia, XN Qi, WX",20757,"[Xia, Xiaona; Qi, Wanxue] Qufu Normal Univ, Fac Educ, Qufu 273165, Shandong, Peoples R China.

"While recent shifts away from sharply demarcated disciplines to cross-curricular K-12 education show great promise for enhancing students' interest and the relevance of subject matter, there remain many challenges to implementation as envisioned, not least among them teacher education. Most current teachers are socialized into disciplinary norms and identities through their pre-service education. To advance cross-curricular teaching, then, teachers need support, including more attention to the instructional design of teacher-facing materials. Without attention to teachers as learners, teachers will continue to implement promising educational innovations only through the lens of their discipline. Using a cognitive interview methodology, we asked how teachers with professional formation in different disciplines would approach a project that purported to connect those disciplines. On the one hand, we found that lesson planning and implementation is a broadly similar task for various types of teachers. On the other hand, we also found that, for the most part, both science and journalism educators focused more heavily on the aspects of a science journalism project that fit within their own discipline. Yet all teachers we interviewed were interested in the possibilities a cross-curricular project opens, which suggests the need for further research on implementation and uptake.","Barchas-Lichtenstein, Jena Sherman, Melina Voiklis, John Clapman, Leah",1279861,"Barchas-Lichtenstein, J Sherman, M Voiklis, J Clapman, L",,"[Barchas-Lichtenstein, Jena; Sherman, Melina; Voiklis, John] Knology, New York, NY 10005 USA.

"The assessment of the current state of the educational system in Bulgaria does not meet the European and national expectations, based on a number of indicators. The main objective of this research is to compare and analyze the dynamics of the system in the period after the changes of 1989 and based on the revealed trends, to identify and rank its challenges, given their importance for the quality of the social capital, created by the system. Objects of the study are the main elements, including the inputs and outputs of the system of preschool and school education in the country: from ISCED-0 to ISCED-3, according to UNESCO's International Standard Classification of Education. The author uses official data, comparative analyzes and assessments of the National Statistical Institute, Eurostat and other European institutions, the World Bank, as well as publications by Bulgarian experts. The results disprove the hypothesis that the decrease in the country's population in the post-socialist period is the main reason for the reduction in the number of schools and teaching staff. Among the most important challenges facing the Bulgarian education system, the problems at the system's input (the school infrastructure, predominantly, at the MSCO-0 level) stand out, as well as the quantity of basic elements of the system, such as teachers and schools. Emphasis is placed on the geospatial aspect of the ongoing deepening of the identified challenges.","Koulov, Boian",,"Koulov, B",311,"[Koulov, Boian] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Climate Atmosphere & Waters Res Inst, Sofia, Bulgaria.",Bulgarian Academy of Sciences,,,,,2025-01-19,education system; Bulgaria; tendencies; challenges; social capital,10.53656/str2024-3-5-edu,Article,,1314-8575,bkoulov@cawri.bas.bg,322,,,,C8B2V,,3,STRATEG POLICY SCI E,Strateg.

"Students are rapidly losing interest in STEM education due to the minimal incorporation of media into learning and the complexity of teaching methods, which ultimately results in a lack of motivation. However, despite these challenges, incorporating active learning methods in STEM can ultimately reignite students' interest in STEM education. This paper reports a case study presenting the effects of simulation games on enhancing the learning experiences of civil engineering students through an intervention method. It develops a framework for enhancing learning through game-based learning. Intervention included the following two groups: a control group exposed to conventional teaching methods and an experimental group introduced to the simulation game. Following the learning sessions, a survey was conducted to gauge students' perceptions about the proposed framework. Results indicated a strong positive response from students toward the game-based learning approach. They expressed satisfaction with its effectiveness in improving their understanding. Independent t-tests found that the mean score (4.13) for entertainment via the game exceeded that of traditional teaching methods (3.72). Furthermore, 85% of students acknowledged the game's utility in reinforcing civil engineering concepts, compared to 67% for traditional methods.

"Extensive research into the effectiveness of problem-based learning (PBL) in primary and secondary education has been carried out over the past few years. PBL is an appealing, promising, but also challenging educational approach for both students and teachers. To overcome challenges, one of the most popular proposed strategies is to build learning scaffolds that gradually help students to effectively resolve the emerging sub-problems and tasks. Moreover, the massive impact of technology on students' lives, and the transition from in-person to distance teaching (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic) highlights the necessity of using virtual worlds and digital tools to facilitate and amplify collaboration and communication, both synchronously and asynchronously. This paper introduces the virtual galleries method as a scaffold for applying PBL approaches in both physical and distance learning environments, within the field of STEM education. Virtual galleries are perceived as a practice that motivates learners to collaborate, express their ideas on solving a problem, and present them as interactive and immersive experiences, while allowing others (peer-learners and educators) to evaluate the produced solutions. In this context, it is argued that virtual galleries can facilitate PBL by serving as a conceptual framework for scaffolding the learning process, thus enabling the acquisition of new PBL-driven skills.","Papasarantou, Chrissa Alimisi, Rene Alimisis, Dimitris",1168,"Papasarantou, C Alimisi, R Alimisis, D",,"[Papasarantou, Chrissa; Alimisi, Rene; Alimisis, Dimitris] EDUMOTIVA, Athens 10556, Greece.",,,,,,2025-01-19,virtual galleries; learning scaffold; problem-solving; collaborative learning; distance learning; STEM education,10.3390/educsci13121168,Review,,2227-7102,cpapasarantou@edumotiva.eu; ralimisi@edumotiva.eu; alimisis@edumotiva.eu,,,,,DI3Q2,,12,EDUC SCI,Educ.

"This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the use of augmented reality technology to support science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning. It synthesizes a set of 28 publications from 2010 to 2017. A qualitative content analysis is used to investigate the general characteristics of augmented reality applications in STEM education, the instructional strategies and techniques deployed in the studies reviewed, and the evaluation approaches followed in the interventions. This review found that most augmented reality applications for STEM learning offered exploration or simulation activities. The applications reviewed offered a number of similar design features based on digital knowledge discovery mechanisms to consume information through the interaction with digital elements. However, few studies provided students with assistance in carrying out learning activities. Most of the studies reviewed evaluated the effects of augmented reality technology in fostering students' conceptual understanding, followed by those that investigated affective learning outcomes. A number of suggestions for future research arose from this review. Researchers need to design features that allow students to acquire basic competences related with STEM disciplines, and future applications need to include metacognitive scaffolding and experimental support for inquiry-based learning activities. Finally, it would be useful to explore how augmented reality learning activities can be part of blended instructional strategies such as the flipped classroom.","Ibanez, Maria-Blanca Delgado-Kloos, Carlos",,"Ibáñez, MB Delgado-Kloos, C",109,"[Ibanez, Maria-Blanca; Delgado-Kloos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,,,,,2025-01-19,Augmented reality; Applications in STEM education; Interactive learning environments; Systematic review,10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.002,Review,,1873-782X,mbibanez@it.uc3m.es; cdk@it.uc3m.es,123,,Spanish project EEE CICYT [TIN2011-28308-C03-01]; RESET-UC3M: Reformulando Ecosistemas Escalables Educativos [CICYT (TIN2014-53199-C3-1-R)]; eMadrid [S2013/ICE-2715],"This work was supported in part by the Spanish project EEE CICYT (TIN2011-28308-C03-01), RESET-UC3M: Reformulando Ecosistemas Escalables Educativos under grant no.

"Effective STEM education is closely linked to teacher professional development (TPD) quality. In response to the evolving demands of STEM education, the Chinese government has implemented numerous TPD programs across various cities and districts. This research systematically reviews 31 studies to identify the common objectives of STEM TPD projects, evaluate their impact on teachers' competencies and instructional methods, and explore factors influencing project outcomes. The methodology involved extracting data and thematic analysis to provide qualitative insights into the effectiveness of TPD programs. The findings highlight a significant emphasis on interdisciplinary integration, innovative curriculum reform, and the development of technological proficiency among STEM teachers. Furthermore, the research identifies the need to extend training periods and provide targeted professional development to address specific regional challenges and the shortage of qualified STEM teachers. While there is a preference for interactive, in-person training sessions, a shift toward online modalities reflects changing professional development paradigms. Integrating STEM fields into educational settings fosters a more dynamic academic environment. However, the review also notes the predominance of interviews and surveys in data collection, underscoring the need for more diverse and robust empirical methodologies. Standardizing data collection and adopting comprehensive evaluation approaches are recommended to enhance the effectiveness of TPD programs. These insights provide a foundation for refining STEM TPD programs in China, calling for more empirical and holistic evaluations in future research.","Rehman, Nadia Huang, Xiao Mahmood, Amir Zafeer, Hafiz Muhammad Ihsan Mohammad, Nhelbourne Kalim",32,"Rehman, N Huang, X Mahmood, A Zafeer, HMI Mohammad, NK",,"[Rehman, Nadia; Huang, Xiao; Mahmood, Amir; Zafeer, Hafiz Muhammad Ihsan] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Educ, Jinhua, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

"There has been an increase in enrollments for students with disabilities in the post-school education sector in South Africa of late. This category of students encounters numerous challenges during their time of study at institutions of learning. It is imperative therefore for tertiary institutions to establish a learning environment that addresses challenges faced by students with disabilities. The public Technical, Vocational Education and Training (TVET) sector in South Africa offers student support services to the enrolled students including this cohort. The paper utilized the qualitative approach and the interpretivist paradigm to derive profound understanding of student support systems in TVET colleges for students with disability. This paper is a case study which focuses on student support systems for students with disabilities. The barriers to the effective utilization of student support services and strategies of mitigating challenges experienced by students with disabilities are explored in this paper. The case study involved student support staff (10) and students (36) from two public TVET colleges in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa on student support systems for students with disabilities. It emerged from the study that students with disability experience challenges that interfere with their academic journey and noted further that the existing student support systems in the TVET sector does not adequately address the varying needs of students with disability.","Munyaradzi, Muchineripi Arko-Achemfuor, Akwasi Quan-Baffour, Kofi",,"Munyaradzi, M Arko-Achemfuor, A Quan-Baffour, K",106,"[Munyaradzi, Muchineripi] Majuba Coll, Dept Higher Educ & Training, Newcastle, South Africa.

"BackgroundInformal caregivers can leverage digital health technologies to support their own health while also assisting patients, particularly those with mental or physical challenges. This study investigated the sociodemographic factors associated with the use of digital health technology among informal caregivers.MethodsData from the 2022 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) were examined for this cross-sectional study. The survey identified key outcomes related to the use of online medical records, health apps, digital wearable health devices, and the digital sharing of health information with professionals, on social media, or with others facing similar health issues. Sociodemographic factors (gender, race/ethnicity, feelings of one's household income, education, and census division) were also analyzed. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were employed. A total of 831 individuals were included, representing about 36,960,385 national informal caregivers in 2022.ResultsCaregivers with a high school education or less (vs. those with at least some college education) and non-Hispanic Black caregivers (vs. non-Hispanic White caregivers) were significantly less likely to be offered access to online medical records by their healthcare providers. Additionally, online medical record usage was lower among caregivers with high school education or less, but higher among caregivers aged 50-64 (vs. those aged 35-49). Caregivers with a high school education or less were less likely to use health apps and digital wearable health devices, but more likely to share personal health information on social media. Men caregivers, those aged 50-64 and over 65 (vs. the 35-49 age group), and caregivers who were dissatisfied with their income were less likely to use digital wearable health devices.ConclusionsThe findings underscore disparities in the utilization of caregivers' digital health technology, particularly in digital wearable health devices. Recognizing and addressing these disparities are crucial for tailoring interventions to enhance equitable access to digital health technology among diverse informal caregiver populations.","Mojtahedi, Zahra Shen, Jay J.",,"Mojtahedi, Z Shen, JJ",,"[Mojtahedi, Zahra; Shen, Jay J.] Univ Nevada, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Healthcare Adm & Policy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.

"Joining the sharpening critique of conventional university-based business school education, we argue that educating students to be integrated catalysts is necessary to meet current sustainability challenges. The key feature of moving toward the integration required at the individual level is focusing on developing students' capacity for moral and cognitive maturity. To effect this, the practice of genuine dialogue is the focus of our interpersonal method for educating management students. In supporting such education, business schools must, however, first transform themselves. As transformative social enterprises, they model critical questioning as well as improve the impact and relevance of management on flourishing wider society and an ethically oriented economy. We offer practical suggestions and implications for future business education reform.","Akrivou, Kleio Bradbury-Huang, Hilary",,"Akrivou, K Bradbury-Huang, H",222,"[Akrivou, Kleio] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.

"Purpose - The Malaysian government has allocated a large budget for Orang Asli primary school education via the Department of Orang Asli Development (JAKOA) to help improve the Orang Asli pupils' academic performance and in, Mathematics as well. Teachers face challenges in ensuring that Orang Asli pupils become competent learners of mathematics. Hence, there is a need to explore the teachers' perspectives on the teaching and learning of Mathematics in the Orang Asli schools. This study examined the teachers' perspectives on the issues and challenges of the teaching and learning of mathematics for the Orang Asli primary school pupils in Malaysia. Methodology - In this qualitative study, two Orang Asli primary schools were randomly selected from eight primary schools within an Orang Asli Settlement in the District of Sungai Siput. The data were collected via focus group discussions and interviews, which were carried out during the enculturation visits and were fully transcribed and thematically analysed. The research participants were purposively selected and comprised the school's administrators and mathematics teachers. Findings - The results of the data analysis show that there are two main themes, namely classroom challenges and school challenges, in determining mathematics competence among Orang Asli pupils. Classroom challenges consists of five sub-themes namely coverage of Mathematics syllabus, Mathematics teaching and learning resources, pupil engagement, language barrier, and Mathematics learning culture. School challenges consists of two sub-themes namely school attendance and discipline. To enhance mathematics competence among Orang Asli pupils, it is deemed important to implement programmes and community engagement. Significance - This study contributes towards the knowledge of teaching and learning of Mathematics for Orang Asli pupils. Teachers are recommended to allow Orang Asli pupils to take home their mathematics textbooks so that they can complete their homework at home. Teachers are highly recommended to conduct mathematics teaching and learning activities in groups for meaningful and engaging lessons.","Md-Ali, Ruzlan Veloo, Arsaythamby Shanmugam, S.

"With the continuous development of society, the pressure of human beings is increasing, and the problem of psychological counseling for school students is getting more and more serious, which has brought great challenges to the education and management of school students. Universities should cultivate students' professional ability on knowledge and practical skills; we should pay more attention to their psychological counseling and develop and design a simple and efficient learning environment. It is very necessary to establish a psychological evaluation system for college students. This article is based on the design and application of the mobile education information system for psychological education. It highlights that the current psychological counseling problems in school education are indispensable. To better manage the psychological counseling problems faced by many students, 67% of the students have many psychological problems, and the mental health of students in school education and psychological counseling have become the common concern and urgent problems of all college managers. This paper uses the methods of literature research, behavior interview, and experimental investigation to investigate the complementary relationship between the connotation of education and psychological counseling from the data of the fuzzy integral model of psychological counseling, so as to pay more attention to the students' mental health problems and make the students grow up healthily. The experimental results of this article show that there is still a lot of room for improvement in the use of mobile education information systems to improve their ability to carry out psychological counseling work.","Ko, Chun-Hung Shen, Yucheng",1789750,"Ko, CH Shen, YC",,"[Ko, Chun-Hung; Shen, Yucheng] Huaiyin Normal Univ, Coll Educ & Sci, Huaian 223300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",Huaiyin Normal University,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1155/2021/1789750,Article,,1875-905X,1094334168@qq.com; 20180008@wzu.edu.cn,,,,,YE4LB,,,MOB INF SYST,Mob.

"This three-year longitudinal case study explored how trilingual Uyghur intranational migrant students utilized digital technologies to learn languages and negotiate their identities in Han-dominant environments during their internal migrations within China, a topic that has been scarcely researched before. Adopting a poststructuralist perspective of identity, the study traced four Uyghur students who migrated from underdeveloped southern Xinjiang to northern Xinjiang for junior high school education, and to more developed cities in eastern and southern China for senior high school education and higher education. A qualitative approach was adopted, utilizing semi-structured interviews, class and campus observations, daily conversations, WeChat conversations, participants' reflections, and assignments. Findings reveal that Uyghur minority students utilized digital technologies to bridge the English proficiency gap with Han students, negotiate their marginalized identities, integrate into the mainstream education system, and extend the empowerment to other ethnic minority students. This was in sharp contrast to the significant challenges and identity crises they faced when they did not have access to digital technologies to learn Mandarin in boarding secondary schools. An unprecedented finding is that, with digital empowerment, Uyghur minority students could achieve accomplishments that were even difficult for Han students to attain and gain upward social mobility by finding employment in Han-dominant first-tier cities. The implications of utilizing digital technologies to support intranational migrant ethnic minority students' language learning and identity development are discussed.","Ye, Xiaoya",,"Ye, XY",,"[Ye, Xiaoya] Capital Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Capital Normal University,,,,,2025-01-19,digital technologies; identity; trilingual; intranational migrations; Uyghur students,10.1017/S0958344024000296,Article; Early Access,JAN 2025,1474-0109,xiaoya.ye@cnu.edu.cn,,,,,R3Z7N,CONSTRUCTION; SELF; MULTILINGUALISM; LITERACY; INSIGHTS; POLICY,,RECALL,ReCALL,English,,41,,,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2025 JAN 6,18,CAMBRIDGE,,,J,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,2025,,"Ye, XY (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Education & Educational Research; Linguistics,,0958-3440,RECALL,,,0,Digital technologies and identity negotiation: a study of trilingual Uyghur university students' language learning experiences in intranational migrations,0,0,WOS:001390876700001,,,Education & Educational Research; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),0
"Primary school teachers play a significant role in preparing students to meet the demands of the 21st century. Balancing the integration of work-related skills into classroom learning while maintaining student motivation presents considerable challenges. This study explored teachers' perceptions of the relationship between student learning and the development of work-related skills through 13 narrative interviews. Data were analysed using phenomenographic and content analyses, revealing three key themes: competence-building, relatedness-focused, and autonomy-related views. Teachers highlighted the importance of developing students' general competencies and cross-contextual skills while fostering a supportive learning environment and promoting a sense of relatedness. Notably, their perceptions were more influenced by past experiences than by current contexts. These findings suggest that teachers recognise the importance of integrating real-world phenomena into classroom learning to prepare students for future challenges. The implications for teacher training include fostering reflective practices to help educators critically examine the influence of personal history on their teaching approaches.","Nakk, Anne-Mai Timostsuk, Inge",681,"Näkk, AM Timostsuk, I",,"[Nakk, Anne-Mai; Timostsuk, Inge] Tallinn Univ, Sch Educ Sci, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia.",Tallinn University,,,,,2025-01-19,teacher perceptions; primary school education; work-related skills; student competencies,10.3390/socsci13120681,Article,,2076-0760,anne-mai.nakk@tlu.ee; inge.timostsuk@tlu.ee,,,HORIZON EUROPE European Research Council;  [TKA22151],This research was funded by the HORIZON EUROPE European Research Council [(grant number TKA22151)].,Q8B7D,SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY; EXPERIENCES; MOTIVATION,12,SOC SCI-BASEL,Soc.

"The given economic, social, environmental and social problems and derivatives from them were significantly exacerbated first by the COVID-19 pandemic, and now by the bloody Russian-Ukrainian war. In these conditions, digitalization and globalization of social life cause an additional need to understand the newest accounting paradigm of accounting, which evokes urgent changes in approaches to education. The world community has accumulated significant educational experience designed to respond to global challenges. In the article, the STEM studied idea is capable of positively changing the training of specialists if its interpretation is adequate to the current challenges facing the educational and intellectual sphere of social life. In connection with the need for students and graduates to acquire new competencies, these trends have a significant impact on accounting, audit and analytical profiles. The purpose of the article is to rethink the accounting paradigm caused by environmental and social factors through the prism of STEM education, which should be implemented in the training of specialists in accounting, auditing and financial analysts. The article deals with the main milestones in the development of the STEM concept and identifies trends in the field of accounting, audit and analysis, which necessitates a review of the educational process organization in the preparation of specialists in these profiles and the determination of the features of the implementation of the STEM concept in accounting education. The novelty of the obtained results lies in the author's approach to the adaptation of STEM in the training of specialists in accounting, audit and analysis based on a deductive approach. The applied value of the article involves the application of the proposed ideas in the educational process and is aimed at increasing the competitiveness of future domestic specialists in order to improve national security, which is extremely important in the face of external threats.","Kutsyk, Petro Shevchuk, Volodymyr Derun, Ivan",,"Kutsyk, P Shevchuk, V Derun, I",22,,,,,,,2025-01-19,analysis; STEM concept; information technology; STEM education; accounting paradigm,10.55643/fcaptp.4.45.2022.3804,Article,,2310-8770,,35,,,,5K4JZ,EDUCATION,45,FINANC CREDIT ACT,Financ.

"Background: Current reforms in K-12 STEM education call for integration between science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Such integration of STEM disciplines at the K-12 level offers students an opportunity to experience learning in real-world, multidisciplinary contexts; however, there is little reported research about teachers' experiences in engaging in integrated STEM instruction. The purpose of this phenomenological multiple case study is to understand nine science teachers' first-time experiences in implementing integrated STEM curricular units in their middle school physical science classrooms. This study draws upon both classroom implementation data and teacher reflective interviews to illustrate different degrees of integrated STEM instruction and to understand teachers' challenges and successes with these varying approaches. Results: Our results indicate three distinct cases of integration within our sample that represent low, medium, and high degrees of STEM integration throughout curriculum implementations. Interviews with teachers from each case revealed three themes that varied across teachers' experiences: the nature of integration, choosing between science and engineering, and student engagement and motivation. Teachers in all three cases were challenged to make explicit connections between science, engineering, and mathematics while simultaneously maintaining a motivating and engaging context for their students throughout their instruction. Further, it appears that the degree of STEM integration that occurs in instruction may be related to teachers' ability to make explicit connections between the disciplines. Conclusions: The work presented here informs educational researchers, policy makers, and K-12 STEM educators that there are several challenges when it comes to implementing new STEM initiatives in K-12 education. Although this work is limited to middle school physical science teachers' experiences with first-time STEM instruction, many of the identified themes are not content-specific; therefore, this work may shed light on general struggles that are common to educators who are integrating across content disciplines for the first time.","Dare, Emily A.

"Introduction Immersive virtual reality (VR) based laboratory demonstrations have been gaining traction in STEM education as they can provide virtual hands-on experience. VR can also facilitate experiential and visual learning and enhanced retention. However, several optimizations of the implementation, in-depth analyses of advantages and trade-offs of the technology, and assessment of receptivity of modern techniques in STEM education are required to ensure better utilization of VR-based labs.Methods In this study, we developed VR-based demonstrations for a biomolecular engineering laboratory and assessed their effectiveness using surveys containing free responses and 5-point Likert scale-based questions. Insta360 Pro2 camera and Meta Quest 2 headsets were used in combination with an in-person lab. A cohort of 53 students watched the experimental demonstration on VR headsets in the lab after a brief lab overview in person and then performed the experiments in the lab.Results Only 28.29% of students reported experiencing some form of discomfort after using the advanced VR equipment as opposed to 63.63% of students from the previous cohort. About 40% of the students reported that VR eliminated or reduced auditory and visual distractions from the environment, the length of the videos was appropriate, and they received enough information to understand the tasks.Discussion The traditional lab method was found to be more suitable for explaining background information and lab concepts while the VR was found to be suitable for demonstrating lab procedures and tasks. Analyzing open-ended questions revealed several factors and recommendations to overcome the potential challenges and pitfalls of integrating VR with traditional modes of learning. This study provides key insights to help optimize the implementation of immersive VR to effectively supplement in-person learning experiences.","Tandon, Ishita Maldonado, Vitali Wilkerson, Megan Walls, Amanda Rao, Raj R.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to establish the status of education for sustainability in the teacher education programmes in the province of Manitoba in Canada and to identify challenges and obstacles for mainstreaming education for sustainability in those programmes. Design/methodology/approach - Using a multi-unit case study design, online programme information and data from interviews with faculty administrators and a convenience sample of faculty members from all five faculties of education in Manitoba were collected and analysed. Findings - There is no systematic and focused preparation of teachers for education for sustainability in any of the Manitoba teacher education programmes. Three challenges for mainstreaming of education for sustainability are identified: lack of leadership, an unfavourable view of the role of education for sustainability and the silo-ing within faculties of education. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited by its focus on the programme-based implementation of education for sustainability in faculties of education, which did not include any course-based implementation by individual instructors. Practical implications - To address the challenges and obstacles for mainstreaming, the authors argue for joint leadership across the relevant institutional levels (government, university and faculty), and for establishing education for sustainability as a framework for responding to the purpose question of school education. Originality/value - The study provides empirical evidence for some of the major challenges for mainstreaming education for sustainability in faculties in education and, by generalisation, all university faculties.","Falkenberg, Thomas Babiuk, Gary",,"Falkenberg, T Babiuk, G",418,"[Falkenberg, Thomas; Babiuk, Gary] Univ Manitoba, Fac Educ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",University of Manitoba,,,,,2025-01-19,Canada; Teacher education; Education for sustainability; Reorienting teacher education to address sustainability; Mainstreaming teacher education for sustainability,10.1108/IJSHE-10-2012-0088,Article,,1758-6739,tfalkenberg@umanitoba.ca,430,,,,AT6FA,CHALLENGES; UNIVERSITY,4,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

"Natural history collections contain billions of specimens which are used to inform our understanding of the biodiversity of our planet. Digitized natural history collections (dNHCs) provide an accessible resource for multiple audiences, including K-12 teachers. The incorporation of dNHCs in K-12 classrooms provides an opportunity to engage students in authentic and practical science experiences. More importantly, through collaboration with museum educators the use of dNHCs can address some of the challenges K-12 teachers face when addressing the Next Generation Science Standards. Using primary data sources will ensure students understand the natural world through the perspective of scientific practices that involve data analyses, structured experiential and inquiry-based learning, and constructing explanations in a hypothesis-testing framework.","Flemming, Adania Phillips, Molly Shea, Elizabeth K.

"STEM education promotes innovation and creativity and provides learners with the opportunity to develop critical thinking, problem solving, and analytical skills, which are all essential for sustainable development. When these skills are applied to real-world situations, they can help to address social, economic, and environmental challenges. STEM education can foster new solutions and technologies that contribute to sustainable development. The objective of this research was to ascertain the degree to which STEM-based teaching can attain sustainable development goals in learning, according to Saudi Arabian educators who have undergone training or have experience in teaching using this approach. In order to achieve this objective, a questionnaire was constructed, and its psychometric properties were validated. The findings of this study indicate that pedagogy based on the STEM approach possesses the capacity to realize sustainable development goals in learning. The goals were ranked based on the degree of effectiveness of STEM-based teaching in achieving them, with the highest average score being obtained for the goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and enhancing lifelong learning opportunities for all, while the lowest average was obtained for the goal of total elimination of hunger. Consequently, this study recommends the adoption of STEM-based teaching as a pedagogical approach that can facilitate the achievement of sustainable development goals in learning over the long term.","Alali, Rommel Alsoud, Khalid Athamneh, Fayez",12542,"Alali, R Alsoud, K Athamneh, F",,"[Alali, Rommel] King Faisal Univ, Natl Res Ctr Giftedness & Creat, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia.

"The rapid development of science and technology worldwide has promoted a boom in STEM education in China, increasing the demand for competent STEM teachers and creating new challenges for training STEM teachers. Teaching competence is crucial to the implementation and quality of STEM education in school, and is influenced in turn by teachers' learning experiences during their preparation programs. This study investigated the longitudinal effects of teacher training experiences on new teachers' perceived teaching competence, with their teaching beliefs as a mediator. Based on the model of Baumert and Kunter (2013), the study collected data from 219 beginner teachers from different K-12 schools in China. The findings showed that knowledge training and teaching practice during teacher education programs, as well as the teachers' beliefs about teaching, were positively related to STEM teachers' perceptions of their teaching competence. Meanwhile, teaching beliefs mediated the relationship between teaching practice and perceived teaching competence. Multigroup analysis revealed similar relationships for both primary and secondary school teachers between teacher training and perceived teaching competence, and between teaching beliefs and perceived competence. However, the relationship between teacher preparation and teaching beliefs was different for the two teacher cohorts, and a significant indirect effect of teaching practice on perceived teaching competence, mediated by teaching beliefs, was observed only in secondary school teachers.","Song, Huan Zhou, Mingming",,"Song, H Zhou, MM",394,"[Song, Huan] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Teacher Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"To address ongoing academic achievement gap, there is a need for more school-university partnerships promoting early access to STEM education. During summer 2020, members of our institute initiated QBio-EDGE (Quantitative Biology-Empowering Diversity and Growth in Education), an outreach program for high schools in Los Angeles. In the hope of contributing to increasing diversity in academia, QBio-EDGE aims to make STEM education more accessible for students from historically excluded communities by exposing them to scientific research and diverse scientist role models. This program is led by early career researchers (ECRs), i.e., undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. In our first year, the outreach activities took place during virtual learning, presenting challenges and opportunities within the program development. Here, we provide a practical guide outlining our outreach efforts, key factors we considered in the program development, and hurdles we overcame. Specifically, we describe how we assembled our diverse team, how we established trusting partnerships with participating schools, and how we designed engaging student-centered, problem-based classroom modules on quantitative biology and computational methods applications to understand living systems. We also discuss the importance of increased institutional support. We hope that this may inspire researchers at all career stages to engage with local schools by participating in science outreach, specifically in quantitative and computational fields. We challenge institutions to actively strengthen these efforts.","Luecke, Stefanie Schiffman, Allison Singh, Apeksha Huang, Helen Shannon, Barbara Wilder, Catera L.",e1011072,"Luecke, S Schiffman, A Singh, A Huang, H Shannon, B Wilder, CL",,"[Luecke, Stefanie; Schiffman, Allison; Singh, Apeksha; Huang, Helen; Wilder, Catera L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Quantitat & Computat Biosci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.

"The development of the Metaverse has drawn much attention in education. Roblox, as an important platform in the Metaverse, attracts millions of young users, which raises the question of how its effectiveness as a learning environment can be maximized. This study aims to synthesize the available evidence to provide an overview of the current research on learning in Roblox by exploring its benefits, challenges, and existing gaps. In line with PRISMA and assisted by LDA topic modeling, we included 40 studies that were analyzed to answer our questions. The research findings show that: (1) Roblox could be combined with social interactive learning or collaborative learning environments, provide a VR environment that supports learning, and be of benefit to programming in STEM education; (2) the use of Roblox in learning has the advantages of attracting a large number of student users, eliciting the positive attitudes of students, and promoting students' cognitive and noncognitive learning abilities; and (3) there are also challenges such as cyberbullying, cybersecurity, lack of adequate teaching design, etc. Empirical studies on this topic have only begun to emerge, and more future research is needed into different pedagogical scenarios to explore the effects, factors, outcomes, designs, etc.","Han, Jining Liu, Geping Gao, Yuxin",296,"Han, JN Liu, GP Gao, YX",,"[Han, Jining; Liu, Geping; Gao, Yuxin] Southwest Univ, Fac Educ, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",Southwest University - China,,,,,2025-01-19,learning in Metaverse; systematic review; latent Dirichlet allocation; benefits; challenges,10.3390/educsci13030296,Review,,2227-7102,jininghan@swu.edu.cn; liugp2@swu.edu.cn; gaoyuxin827@swu.edu.cn,,,,,A5GI8,ONLINE EDUCATION; SOCIAL MEDIA; CYBERSECURITY; AWARENESS,3,EDUC SCI,Educ.

"This research aims to examine: (a) how Physics teachers who participated in a STEM project, adopted and implemented a STEM activity in the context of a pandemic; (b) from the perspective of Physics teachers, what were the effects on students' learning of a STEM activity implemented in the context of the pandemic; (c) what challenges had Physics teachers faced in implementing the STEM activity during the pandemic. A qualitative and interpretive methodology was used. The participants are four Physics teachers who implemented a STEM activity on sound, during the pandemic. Data were collected through interviews and written reflections. The study has shown how, in a crisis context such as COVID-19, which affected schools all around the world, teachers were able to deal with it and kept developing a STEM activity, revealing the main challenges and effects on student learning, from the teachers' points of view. Moreover, it was clear that carrying out with success a STEM activity, in such an adverse scenario, was strongly related with teachers who found new strategies and keep students motivated, by guiding them proficiently, and that requires to merge scientific and technological knowledge.","Baptista, Monica Costa, Estela Martins, Iva",,"Baptista, M Costa, E Martins, I",1043,"[Baptista, Monica; Costa, Estela; Martins, Iva] Univ Lisbon, Inst Educ, Alameda Univ, P-1649013 Lisbon, Portugal.",Universidade de Lisboa,,,,,2025-01-19,COVID-19; pandemic context; physics teachers; online teaching; STEM activity,10.33225/jbse/20.19.1043,Article,,,mbaptista@ie.ulisboa.pt; ecosta@ie.ulisboa.pt; ivamartins@ie.ulisboa.pt,1054,,"national Funds through FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P.

"Despite the positive impact of maker education on student learning, challenges towards its implementation in formal school settings still exist. There is limited research on maker education in teacher education programs and a lack of knowledge on how to integrate it into the mathematics classroom. To address these issues, the following research questions were examined: What is the nature of the productive design features of maker education for teacher candidates? What are the benefits and challenges of these opportunities for teacher candidates learning to teach mathematics? The methods used were a case study interlinked with design-based research. A total of 114 teacher candidates participated in the study. The research findings have implications for educators who design/ implement maker education curricula into STEM courses. For educators and researchers, the maker education opportunities from this study contribute to further re-imagining learning competencies, pedagogy, and resources in teaching mathematics and other STEM disciplines.","Namukasa, Immaculate Kizito Bertrand, Marja Gabrielle Tangredi, Derek Roy, Jade Barek, Hiba Campigotto, Rachelle Aryee, Kinful Lartebea",324166,"Namukasa, IK Bertrand, MG Tangredi, D Roy, J Barek, H Campigotto, R Aryee, KL",,"[Namukasa, Immaculate Kizito; Bertrand, Marja Gabrielle] Western Univ, Fac Educ, London, ON, Canada.

This model aims to help program designers and researchers address challenges particular to designing, implementing, and studying education innovations in the ITEST program, considering ongoing needs and challenges in STEM workforce education in the USA. It is grounded in conceptual frameworks developed previously by teams of ITEST constituents, for their part intended to frame STEM career education, consider how people select and prepare for STEM careers, and reinforce the important distinction between STEM content and STEM career learnings. The authors take a first step in what they hope will be an ongoing discussion and research agenda by test-fitting assumptions of the model to exploratory case studies of recent NSF ITEST projects.

"Neurodivergent students exhibit an inclination towards Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, yet their learning experiences in STEM courses remain underexamined. Utilizing an online survey of neurodivergent (n = 60) and neurotypical (n = 83) US college students, this study identified various factors influencing their self-perceived learning experiences, including interest in the course content, instruction quality and performance outcomes. Compared to their neurotypical peers, neurodivergent students attributed negative experiences in STEM courses less frequently to performance-related factors and more often to a mismatch between their interests and the course content. Both groups also articulated a variety of strengths and challenges encountered in their STEM studies. Neurodivergent students were more likely to report having interest and passion for STEM and less likely to report having peer support and effective study skills and habits as their primary strength for studying STEM. Conversely, while neurotypical students cited difficult content as their central challenge, neurodivergent students more commonly faced challenges with focus and attention. Despite the study's limited sample size, it revealed emerging patterns that emphasize the importance of developing inclusive teaching methods and specific support mechanisms to cater to the unique strengths and challenges of neurodivergent students in higher education.","Wang, Karen D.

In particular, it focuses on the importance of the mutual relationship between local communities and schools. Tanedori refers to the ritual of planting rice or millet. In the past this ritual was performed all over Okinawa Prefecture. Tanedori faces the same sort of challenges as many other intangible heritage activities - lack of people to carry on the tradition and a declining and aging local population.

"The serious problems of our world demand an urgent educative answer by the school system, but so far that answer is not adequate, because the system continues working with very traditional characteristics. Citizenship education appears as a possibility of reorienting the education towards purposes more in agreement with the challenges that are currently faced; nevertheless, between the official declarations and initiatives and the reality of education there is still a great distance. In that sense, it is urgent to redefine the basic aims of school education and to recover its dimension of education for democratic citizenship, granting an important role to participation. The proposal would be to work around relevant social and environmental problems of our world within the framework of an integrated curriculum.","Garcia-Perez, Francisco F.

"Menstrual management is recognized as a critical issue for young people internationally. Relatively little published research explores issues pertaining to menstruation in school education. This paper is based on the results of an Australian survey of 5007 young women aged 13-25, which examined their experiences of menstruation and dysmenorrhea. It focuses specifically on participant qualitative responses to the question, ""What do you think schools could do to better support girls during their period?"" Six key themes were identified across responses. These related to sanitation; pain management; removing stigma; adequate breaks; and being considerate. The findings reported herein highlight some of the challenges menstruating young people encounter at school and give voice to their needs; these have important implications for school improvement in this area.","Ferfolja, Tania Holmes, Kathryn Curry, Christina Sherry, Kelly Parry, Kelly Armour, Mike",,"Ferfolja, T Holmes, K Curry, C Sherry Parry, K Armour, M",611,"[Ferfolja, Tania; Holmes, Kathryn; Curry, Christina; Parry, Kelly] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Educ, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.

"This paper examines the role of school inspection in the early (1861-1910) professionalisation of Swedish elementary school teachers. International research on school inspection has focused on educational reform, but rarely on the role of inspection in teachers' theoretical and practical development. The paper's theoretical assumption is that school inspection was initiated by the Swedish state as part of its effort to professionalise teaching in the 1860s. Using inspectors' reports, the paper examines two specific areas: (1) the quality of teaching observed in the classroom and inspectors' recommendations for improvement, and (2) the development of teachers' seminars and continuous pedagogic development. The results demonstrate that, although faced with various challenges, inspectors contributed to teacher development, indicating the benefit of state intervention in elementary school education.","Evertsson, Jakob",,"Evertsson, J",500,"[Evertsson, Jakob] Uppsala Univ, Dept Hist, Uppsala, Sweden.",Uppsala University,,,,,2025-01-19,School inspection; professionalisation; elementary school; nineteenth century; Sweden,10.1080/0046760X.2021.2002434,Article,MAR 2022,1464-5130,jakob.evertsson@hist.uu.se,521,,Swedish Research Council [2018-05479]; Swedish Research Council [2018-05479] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council,This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council under grant number [2018-05479].,4J6HZ,,4,HIST EDUC,Hist.

"Current challenges in medical practice, research, and administration demand physicians who are familiar with bioethics, health law, and health economics. Curriculum directors at American Association of Medical Colleges-affiliated medical schools were sent confidential surveys requesting the number of required hours of the above subjects and the years in which they were taught, as well as instructor names. The number of relevant publications since 1990 for each named instructor was assessed by a PubMed search. In sum, teaching in all three subjects combined comprises less than two percent of the total hours in the American medical curriculum, and most instructors have not recently published articles in the fields they teach. This suggests that medical schools should reevaluate their curricula and instructors in bioethics, health law, and health economics.","Persad, Govind C.

"This article is part of a broader research that challenges unraveling the schooling process of the Mebengokre Gorotire, an indigenous territory located in the municipality of Cumaru do Norte-PA, in the light of Thematic Oral History. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the Mebengokre: Tumre Kayapo, Mryre Kayapo, Kamrore Kayapo and Bepmoti Kayapo. The oral narratives indicate that the school was implanted in the Gorotire village in 1973, by evangelical missionaries, under the administrative aegis of the National Foundation of the Indian, and currently operationalized technically, pedagogically and administratively by the municipal and state education network. In contemporary educational contexts, the school, in the Mebengokre Gorotire territory, is represented as a space for reaffirming its identity, as well as for appropriating the non-indigenous way of life.","Feitosa, Leni Barbosa Vizolli, Idemar dos Santos, Jocyleia Santana",,"Feitosa, LB Vizolli, I dos Santos, JS",393,"[Feitosa, Leni Barbosa] Secretaria Estadual Educ Para & Secretaria Munici, Redencao, PA, Brazil.

"Regular practice of physical activity is one of the elements that determine people's quality of life. In this respect, the World Health Organization defines 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic physical activity, 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both, as minimum parameters for the adult population aged between 18 and 64 years old. In this study We analyzed the influence that a challenge methodology has on the achievement of these recommendations. To this end, 80 students (13 men and 67 women) from the university degrees in Teaching in Primary School Education (52) and Nursery School Education (28) of the Faculty of Education (University of Zaragoza), with an average age of 21.5.83 years old, participated in the study. They were randomly distributed into three experimental groups: group one, with traditional measures to promote physical activity; group two, using applications for mobile devices; group three, using physical activity bracelets. The IPAQ questionnaire was used to collect data on the amount of physical activity performed. Specifically, reasons for increased physical exercise were collected using theAMPEF questionnaire The results showed an improvement in the number of students fulfilling the healthy recommendations after seven weeks. The challenge factor appears as a remarkable reason in the three experimental groups. Groups two and three highlighted the immediacy of the information provided by the ICT tools, which allows greater control and monitoring of the exercise challenges posed.","Penarrubia-Lozano, Carlos Romero-Roso, Lucia Oloriz-Nivela, Maria Lizalde-Gil, Manuel",,"Peñarrubia-Lozano, C Romero-Roso, L Olóriz-Nivela, M Lizalde-Gil, M",58,"[Penarrubia-Lozano, Carlos; Romero-Roso, Lucia; Oloriz-Nivela, Maria; Lizalde-Gil, Manuel] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",University of Zaragoza,,,,,2025-01-19,motivation; health; WHO; information and communication technologies; higher education; challenge,,Article,,1988-2041,carlospl@unizar.es,64,,,,NX5IZ,INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; CLIMATE; SPORT; HABITS,39,RETOS-NUEV TEND EDUC,Retos,Spanish,,44,"Green Published, gold","Penarrubia Lozano, Carlos/0000-0002-3776-2901","C CABO VIDIO 27, SAN JAVIER, MURCIA, 30730, SPAIN",,7,MURCIA,,,J,FEDERACION ESPANOLA ASOC DOCENTES EDUCACION FISICA-FEADEF,2021,"Peñarrubia-Lozano, Carlos/L-7068-2018","Peñarrubia-Lozano, C (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",Social Sciences - Other Topics,,1579-1726,RETOS-NUEVAS TENDENCIAS EN EDUCACION FISICA DEPORTE Y RECREACION,,,3,Challenge as a strategy to promote physical activity in university students,0,40,WOS:000575745900001,,,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),3

The objective is to contribute to the discussion and dialogue regarding indigenous education througt the lens of the indigenous people themselves. It will include reports of elders who are knowledgeable about knowledge, young people, teachers of the Jula Pare school of indigenous education, data obtained by participant observation, its largest source and bibliographical sources. It is a record told by the indigenous researcher belonging to the said people and will promote the strengthening and dissemination of ancestral knowledge. In the school space there is a network of dialogue, an interaction between teachers, students, parents, chief, leaders, elders and community practicing ancestral actions such as dances, songs, language, body painting, stories, rituals and typical foods, crafting, traditional festival, which is held in the month of April, is the place that connects the making and learning of knowledge, as well as fosters questions about the spirituality and the conception of youth of the present compared to the past generation. It is important that elders teach knowledge, traditional knowledge for children and young people so that they can learn, build and rebuild values, be protagonists and have an indigenous Balatipone-Umutina conception.","Monzilar, Eliane Boroponepa",,"Monzilar, EB",,"[Monzilar, Eliane Boroponepa] Univ Brasilia UNB, Secretaria Educ Mato Grosso SEDUC, Escola Educ Indigena Jula Pare, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",Universidade de Brasilia,,,,,2025-01-19,School; Learning; Indigenous education; Knowledge,10.14507/epaa.28.4769,Article,,1068-2341,elibmonzilar@gmail.com,,,,,LL4JF,,,ED POLICY ANAL ARCH,Educ.

"Engaging, hands-on design experiences are key for formal and informal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Robotic and video game design challenges have been particularly effective in stimulating student interest, but equivalent experiences for the life sciences are not as developed. Here we present the concept of a ""biotic game design project"" to motivate student learning at the interface of life sciences and device engineering (as part of a cornerstone bioengineering devices course). We provide all course material and also present efforts in adapting the project's complexity to serve other time frames, age groups, learning focuses, and budgets. Students self-reported that they found the biotic game project fun and motivating, resulting in increased effort. Hence this type of design project could generate excitement and educational impact similar to robotics and video games.","Cira, Nate J. Chung, Alice M. Denisin, Aleksandra K.

"To facilitate effective provision of government support to local fabricators and improve their exposure to prospective clients in order to boost their productivity, it is necessary to understand the challenges currently impeding existing businesses as well as prospects at play with a view to identifying and promoting some recommendations and suggestions. The study explored the status, challenges and prospects of food processing equipment fab-ricators in three regions of Ghana: Greater Accra, Ashanti and Volta. The research gener-ated an updated database of fabricators, identified relevant challenges and prospects, and established a relationship between the education level of respondents and the types of food processing equipment fabricated. A total of 101 fabricators answered the structured questionnaire. Majority of respondents (81%) were married. 41% had junior high school and 20% senior high school education. Farming (31%) and trading (23.8%) provided the high -est secondary sources of income to fabricators. 953 dependents were found to be direct beneficiaries of income generated from fabrication works. 33 food processing equipment were recorded with the fufu extruder and cassava grater obtaining the highest frequencies. 33.9% of respondents had not registered their businesses with the Registrar General's De-partment. Cross reference analysis depicted that education level of fabricators influenced the types of equipment fabricated; most especially in the fabrication of palm fruit boilers. The work recommends downward review of electricity and import tariffs of fabrication raw materials and machine spare parts, regular capacity building programs, and reduced requirements for company registration and association membership to boost productivity in the sector.

"Cold temperature (<= 20 degrees C) storage or handling is required to maintain the quality characteristics of chocolate after production throughout the supply chain. The objective of this study was to assess the retail conditions, challenges, and willingness of retailers to use cooling devices. A total of 228 chocolate retailers sampled from Kumasi and Accra were interviewed using questionnaires with both closed and open-ended questions. The purposive, snowballing, and random sampling techniques were used. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 26. The majority of the respondents were female (82 %), aged between 21 and 30 years (33.9 %) and had a maximum of Junior High School education (39.0 %). About 15.4 % were registered retailers of Cocoa Processing Company- Ghana, 56.1 % sold on the streets of which 71.1 % sold under no shade and 71.9 % sold all day. A proportion of 76.2 % reported having challenges in their chocolate retail business. Among these challenges softening dominated with about 78.1 % of the retailers reported experiencing it in their daily operations. Spoilage (18.9 %), damage during handling (35.1 %), oily surface (34.2 %), darker surface appearance (10.1 %), and whitish surface appearance (39.9 %) were other challenges faced by retailers. The majority (76.8 %) of the respondents affirmed elevated temperatures caused melting, oil leakage and fat bloom in chocolate leading to rejections by clients. A significant proportion (81.1 %) indicated a cooling device for retail is necessary and were willing to use it when made available. The findings show that vending conditions were generally unsuitable for the shelf-stability of chocolates. An innovative vending device with cooling system would serve as possible intervention to mitigate the challenges faced by chocolate retailers.","Abe-Inge, Vincent Arabe, James Agbenorhevi, Jacob K.

Educators in the twenty-first century need to think of innovative ways to engage and prepare students for current and future challenges while cultivating an interest among students in STEM disciplines. This study sought to investigate the impact of problem-based learning on students' content knowledge and critical thinking towards STEM. This study employed a quasi-experimental repeated measure design. Instruments such as STEM content assessments and a standardized critical thinking test were employed for data collection. Analysis was conducted using a mixed repeated measure between-within subject analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results revealed a significant difference (p <. 05) between problem-based learning and traditional learning groups in regard to their content knowledge and critical thinking skills.,"Rehmat, Abeera P.

"The 1970s saw the beginning of the process of initial formation of indigenous teachers, forming bilingual monitors. As of the 1988 Constitution and Decree No. 26 of 1991, the policy of indigenous school education becomes the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, enabling the creation of a wide and specific legislation for this type of teaching, among them the Guidelines that define and guide the formulation of specific programs and courses aimed at the formation of indigenous teachers. In this text, which seeks to analyze the advances and challenges of the initial formation of indigenous teachers, we present the actions developed in the state of Parana based on qualitative and quantitative research of bibliographic and documentary nature. We note that the state has advanced, however, there is still a need to increase the number of teachers formed at a higher level to work at indigenous schools, as well as the offer of specific and intercultural teaching degrees that enable the integral formation of the indigenous individual in their aspects of territory, culture, language, methodologies and conceptions of teaching and learning that consider the proper ways of learning in relation to ethnographic knowledge.","Berdusco Menezes, Maria Christine Faustino, Rosangela Celia Jacomini Novak, Maria Simone",,"Menezes, MCB Faustino, RC Novak, MSJ",908,"[Berdusco Menezes, Maria Christine] State Univ Maringa UEM, Postgrad Program Educ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil.

"The article explores the potential of applying process drama in moral education in Chinese schools. By conducting a thematic review of the current national curriculum and policy documents from both historical and contemporary perspectives, the interconnection between the role of art and moral cultivation in China is discussed. Through an analysis of the national curriculum, the article suggests that applying process drama in school education can contribute to learning in the curriculum areas of both aesthetic and moral education. However, the existing commingling of concepts and definitions influences the actual drama practices in China. Consequently, a discussion of terminology is brought in, as well as an argument for the need to include drama as a discrete subject in schools, in addition to its function as a method for educational purposes. A process drama sample from the author's drama praxis is included. The overall aim of the article is to contribute to an extended understanding of educational drama and theatre in a Chinese context and to gain new insights into possibilities and challenges for the future implementation of drama in education in China.","Zheng, Sisi",,"Zheng, SS",155,"[Zheng, Sisi] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Hogskulen Pa Vestlandet, POB 7030, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",Western Norway University of Applied Sciences,,,,,2025-01-19,aesthetic education; Chinese curriculum; drama education; educational drama; moral education; process drama,10.1386/atr_00055_1,Article,,2049-3029,sizh@hvl.no,172,,,,XN0FI,,2,APPL THEATRE RES,Appl.

"Challenges to recruitment of family caregivers exist and are amplified when consent must occur in the context of chaotic healthcare circumstances, such as the transition from hospital to home. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic during our randomized controlled trial provided an opportunity for a natural experiment exploring and examining different consent processes for caregiver recruitment. The purpose of this publication is to describe different recruitment processes (in-person versus virtual) and compare diversity in recruitment rates in the context of a care recipient's hospitalization. We found rates of family caregiver recruitment for in-person versus virtual were 28% and 23%, respectively (p = 0.01). Differences existed across groups with family caregivers recruited virtually being more likely to be younger, white, have greater than high school education, and not be a spouse or significant other to the care recipient, such as a child. Future work is still needed to identify the modality and timing of family caregiver recruitment to maximize rates and enhance the representativeness of the population for equitable impact.","Gustavson, Allison M.

"Although science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors remain male dominated, women's greater enrollment in STEM is one of the greatest transformations to occur in U.S. higher education in the past half century. But to what extent have women's gains in STEM enrollment translated to greater parity in labor market outcomes? Although the challenges women face in STEM have been well documented, questions about the influence of gender for STEM employment and earnings differences remain. In the present research, the authors use data from recent birth cohorts in the American Community Survey between 2009 and 2018 (starting with the first year college majors were available in the survey) and a reweighting technique from labor economics to track the evolution of gender inequalities in STEM employment and earnings inequality among STEM work at the onset of labor market entry. Even among a sample expected to produce highly conservative gender differences, sizable gender inequalities in STEM employment are observed. The authors show that despite women's gains in STEM education among recent cohorts, women with STEM degrees face employment prospects in STEM work that more closely resemble those of men without STEM degrees than men with STEM degrees. Moreover, although modest gender earnings gaps eventually emerge for those without STEM degrees, large gaps occur at the outset of employment for STEM workers. Thus, although STEM education provides important opportunities for women's earning potential, it may be less effective in itself to address significant gender inequalities among STEM employment.","VanHeuvelen, Tom Quadlin, Natasha",23780231211064392,"VanHeuvelen, T Quadlin, N",,"[VanHeuvelen, Tom] Univ Minnesota, Sociol, Minneapolis, MN USA.

"BackgroundIndigenous knowledge systems (IKS) are increasingly perceived as a top global priority for empowering local communities towards a more inclusive and sustainable national development trajectory. However, there are persistent challenges that indigenous learners are facing in terms of access to and success in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.PurposeThis review sought to find out how IKS can be and are being integrated into STEM education. It was grounded on the view that adopting a culturally responsive STEM curriculum provides indigenous learners with enhanced opportunities to engage with scientific knowledge and to improve their efficacy towards STEM disciplines.MethodWe searched for publications from 2018 to 2023 through the following databases: Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ERIC, Teacher Reference Centre, and Education Source. The final 22 articles were included after a stringent screening and selection process for eligibility.FindingsAfter a rigorous exercise of iteratively revising and rearranging identified codes, four themes emerged from the studies. We established that there is a lot of traditional knowledge embedded within local communities that are largely ignored, and not capitalised on, in the development and delivery of STEM content in schools. The review found that indigenous real-world contexts, that learners are familiar with, provide fertile ground for more meaningful and motivating learner engagement with STEM concepts. Local artifacts provide a scaffolding effect to the learner's thinking processes, supported by other psychological tools.RecommendationWe cogently recommend that curriculum designers, community representatives, and STEM practitioners should work synergically to develop a STEM curriculum that is sensitive and responsive to cultural perspectives.","Matindike, Fanuel Ramdhany, Virendra",,"Matindike, F Ramdhany, V",,"[Matindike, Fanuel; Ramdhany, Virendra] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Sci & Technol Educ, Auckland Pk, Johannesburg, South Africa.",University of Johannesburg,,,,,2025-01-19,Indigenous knowledge systems; western; curriculum; STEM; cultural,10.1080/02635143.2024.2413675,Review; Early Access,OCT 2024,1470-1138,fmatindike@yahoo.com,,,,,I8R0U,SCIENCE; STUDENTS,,RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC,Res.

"Differentiated instruction (DI) is an inclusive method of instruction by which teachers provide multiple possibilities for learning based on students' backgrounds, readiness, interests, and profiles. Acknowledging student diversity in Canadian classrooms, this study explores STEM teacher candidates' (TCs') preparation to implement DI in a STEM curriculum and pedagogy course in a teacher education program. The course is enriched with DI resources and training focused on equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). The course efficacy in enhancing TCs' implementation of DI is explored through the following research questions: (1) What is the impact of the course on TCs' implementation of DI, (2) How do TCs develop curricula to be inclusive of DI strategies, and (3) What successes and challenges do TCs encounter when developing DI-focused curricula? The study adopts a mixed-method approach, in which data sources include pre-post questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Participants are 19 TCs enrolled in the second year of the teacher education program at a Canadian university. Findings suggest that the course empowered TCs to integrate DI principles and strategies in their coursework. This success reiterates the importance of opportunities aimed at enhancing teachers' preparation to incorporate DI in their practices. The findings call for adopting similar approaches in pre-service and in-service teachers' training to ensure that DI principles and strategies are deeply rooted in teachers' practices. The study informs teacher educators about integrating EDI in teacher education programs' curriculum and overall planning.","Estaiteyeh, Mohammed DeCoito, Isha",,"Estaiteyeh, M DeCoito, I",5,"[Estaiteyeh, Mohammed] Brock Univ, Fac Educ, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.

": Brazil has historically faced crises in high school education, and various reforms have aimed to overcome the challenges at this educational level. Currently, there is a new wave of policy reformulation in this area, as the current legislation presents weaknesses in its implementation. This qualitative research, of a bibliographic and documentary nature, intends to analyze youth culture and the significance of high school for young people so that they can recognize themselves in the curricula and daily school life. The high dropout and abandonment rates in high school should be a focal point for public policies, as education is the starting point for other professional, social, and cultural achievements. Considering the transformations in youth trajectories throughout history is fundamental for thinking about high school reforms, viewing education as a process of collective knowledge construction, and seeking the wholeness of the human being.","Zluhan, Mara Regina dos Santos, Adelcio Machado Correa, Shirlei de Souza",e023017,"Zluhan, MR dos Santos, AM Corrêa, SD",,"[Zluhan, Mara Regina] Rede Estadual Educ St Catarina, Balneario, SC, Brazil.

"Globally, few students with disabilities progress to higher education. This is mostly due to avoidable barriers they face as they navigate different educational structures from lower levels. Even for those few students who make it to higher education, they continue to face challenges. A qualitative study was carried out at the University of the Free State and the University of Venda. Fourteen students with disabilities took part in this research that was aimed at exploring their academic and life experiences. This article interrogates the inclusion of students with disabilities at two South African universities. This article is timely as South Africa has initiated the development of a national policy framework on disability in the post-school education and training systems.

"Field Education arises in Brazil as a result of the struggle process of rural social movements, especially the Settled Rural Workers Movement (MST). Thus, this work aims to demonstrate that despite public policies for rural education, major advances, the current reality of rural schools reveals the existence of a chasm between such policies and the educational challenges to be faced by schools in rural areas. Analyzes carried out in the light of the 2018 School Education Census (BRASIL, 2019) reveal the great precariousness of the infrastructure of these schools and the closing of a significant number of them in recent years. All these problems pointed out, as a result of the abandonment of our governors, cause great difficulties in the teaching and learning process of rural students and also contribute to a significant number of children and young people in rural areas remaining out of school.","Machado, Vitor Tsuchiya, Amanda Matheus",e20630,"Machado, V Tsuchiya, AM",,"[Machado, Vitor] Univ Estadual Paulista Julio de Mesquita Filho UN, Educ, Bauru, SP, Brazil.

"Currently, Australian boarding schools undertake to provide a home away from home for around 20,000 adolescents. Research documenting the boarding school experience is scarce, and, with few exceptions, exists as a less significant aspect of more general research into private school education. Such school-based research focuses on the positive, character-building benefits of the boarding experience. However, case studies of former boarders paint quite a different picture. In order for boarding schools to best support boarders' development, it is vital that adults who fulfil a parenting role undertake appropriate training. This paper draws together available information to present a comprehensive picture of boarding in Australian schools, with a focus on the challenges faced by the in loco parentis role of staff. It is apparent that more skills-based training is vital to better equip staff in this very important role.","Hodges, Julie Sheffield, Jeanie Ralph, Alan",,"Hodges, J Sheffield, J Ralph, A",32,"[Hodges, Julie; Sheffield, Jeanie] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.

A multi-level framework is employed to critically examine the current government policy on quality education with reference to nine schools from five levels: individual student, institutional, government, societal and professional learning community. Discrepancies between policy goals and school practices are highlighted.

"In this article, we advocate for innovation in public relations pedagogy by importing ideas and practices from four areas. The first area involves work on disruptive technology and education that applies lessons from Silicon Valley innovations to high school education. The second area considers how knowledge management and project management findings confirm the value of teaching as the cocreation of knowledge. The third draws parallels between the challenges of moving from traditional to future management and moving from traditional to future education. All three areas offer models for innovation by adopting a more improvisational, experimental, and risk-taking ethos in education. In the fourth area, we shift from theoretical advocacy to look at how these innovations feed into an example of public relations pedagogy as co-created stakeholder participation.

Majority of participants reported stresses from feelings of ""sink or swim"" in a digital world, without supports from schools to effectively provide for their children's technology needs. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of family-school collaborative engagement and empowerment. Digital technology needs to become part of our school education system so that technology use among African Americans is elevated and families protected against future outbreaks. Further research with a more diverse African American sample is needed.","Anakwe, Adaobi Majee, Wilson Noel-London, Kemba Zachary, Iris BeLue, Rhonda",4290,"Anakwe, A Majee, W Noel-London, K Zachary, I BeLue, R",,"[Anakwe, Adaobi] St Louis Univ, Coll Publ Hlth & Social Justice, St Louis, MO 63104 USA.

"Homeschooling has developed from a small, isolated, parent-led effort to a vibrant national movement to lobby for and legalize K- 12 education at home in all 50 states. Although a majority of homeschool families are Evangelical Christians, the others come from a variety of religious and nonreligious backgrounds, giving homeschooling a broad national political and social base. Homeschool families have organized regional and national associations, gained children's access to after-school and even during-school classes and activities in local public schools, and increasingly gained entry to college. About 1.35 million children in the country are being officially homeschooled, making it a vital and expanding form of private education and political force in U.S. society.","Cooper, Bruce S.

"This study investigates parents' perceptions on school management practices for children with special educational needs in a small-sized Indonesian school. Data from surveys and interviews with 53 parents revealed overall positive attitudes toward classroom management and teacher care. However, concerns arose regarding teachers' ability to support special needs students effectively, leading to hesitancy in collaborating for inclusive classrooms. To reorient parental perceptions to create conditions for successful inclusive education, effective communication strategies emphasizing teacher development and district-based support are crucial. Future research should focus on improving communication between parents to foster inclusive educational practices. These findings shed light on challenges and solutions for cultivating inclusive classroom environments in special education.","Narot, Pennee Kiettikunwong, Narong",358,"Narot, P Kiettikunwong, N",,"[Narot, Pennee] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Educ, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.

"This article aims to analyze and present the perception of teachers in the early years of a municipal education system about human rights education in the context of public school. The research was methodologically constructed based on the responses of the regent teachers of specific subjects to a questionnaire. It should be noted that the teachers act in the planning of classes, activities and in the proposition of pedagogical material related to the theme. The analysis of the results shows that approximately 70% of the teachers who answered the questionnaire perceived the existence of challenges to approach the theme in the context of public school education. It was also observed the consent of teachers about the relevance of education in human rights as a basis for new pedagogical practices that transform society.","Carvalho, Ademar de Lima Freitas de Luna, Jose Marcelo da Silva Santos, Jonatas Marcos",,"Carvalho, AD de Luna, JMF Santos, JMD",532,"[Carvalho, Ademar de Lima] Fed Univ Rondonopolis UFR, Dept Educ, Rondonopolis, MT, Brazil.

"In recent decades, an essential global aim of the reforms of special education has been the promotion of inclusive education. This article discusses the implementation of reforms with a focus on tiered support systems in the context of Finnish comprehensive school education. Based on earlier literature, legislation, and administrative documents, we provide a background for Finnish education policy and special education reforms. The focus of this article is on the description of parallel reforms targeting the re-structuring of the systems around support for students and funding of education in the 2010s. We discuss the processes leading to these reforms and the reforms themselves. In addition, we discuss their implications for the organization of the tiered support system. Finally, we highlight some challenges of reform implementation and the current education policy's movements towards inclusive education.","Ahtiainen, Raisa Pulkkinen, Jonna Jahnukainen, Markku",750,"Ahtiainen, R Pulkkinen, J Jahnukainen, M",,"[Ahtiainen, Raisa; Jahnukainen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, Helsinki 00014, Finland.

"Although the etiology of chronic pain following trauma is not well understood, numerous retrospective studies have shown that a significant proportion of chronic pain patients have a history of traumatic injury. The present analysis examines the prevalence and early predictors of chronic pain in a cohort of prospectively followed severe lower extremity trauma patients. Chronic pain was measured using the Graded Chronic Pain Scale, which measures both pain severity and pain interference with activities. Severe lower extremity trauma patients report significantly higher levels of chronic pain than the general population (p < 0.001). Their levels are comparable to primary care migraine headache and back pain populations. A number of early predictors of chronic pain were identified, including: having less than a high school education (p < 0.01), having less than a college education (p < 0.001), low self-efficacy for return to usual major activities (p < 0.01), and high levels of average alcohol consumption at baseline (p < 0.05). In addition, high reported pain intensity, high levels of sleep and rest dysfunction, and elevated levels of depression and anxiety at 3 months post-discharge were also strong predictors of chronic pain at seven years (p < 0.001 for all three predictors). After adjusting for early pain intensity, patients treated with narcotic medication during the first 3 months post-discharge had lower levels of chronic pain at 84 months. It is possible that for patients within these high risk categories, early referral to pain management and/or psychologic intervention may reduce the likelihood or severity of chronic pain.

"Navigating scientific challenges, persevering through difficulties, and coping with failure are considered hallmarks of a successful scientist. However, relatively few studies investigate how undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students develop these skills and dispositions or how instructors can facilitate this development in undergraduate STEM learning contexts. This is a critical gap, because the unique cultures and practices found in STEM classrooms are likely to influence how students approach challenges and deal with failures, both during their STEM education and in the years that follow. To guide research aimed at understanding how STEM students develop a challenge-engaging disposition and the ability to adaptively cope with failure, we generate a model representing hypotheses of how students might approach challenges and respond to failures in undergraduate STEM learning contexts. We draw from theory and studies investigating mindset, goal orientations, attributions, fear of failure, and coping to inform our model. We offer this model as a tool for the community to test, revise, elaborate, or refute. Finally, we urge researchers and educators to consider the development, implementation, and rigorous testing of interventions aimed at helping students develop a persevering and challenge-engaging disposition within STEM contexts.","Henry, Meredith A.

"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, school closures were mandated by governments across the globe. This necessitated an abrupt shift to online/distance teaching. Through a mixed-methods study, the authors explored STEM teachers' transition to online teaching and learning in a Canadian context. This subset of the larger study investigated (i) teachers' views of and attitude toward online teaching and (ii) successes and challenges encountered with online teaching. Data were collected through an online questionnaire administered to 70 Grade 1-12 science/STEM subject teachers in a Canadian province between May and July 2020. Findings are discussed through the lens of self-efficacy theory and the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. Results indicate that despite few successes, teachers faced a wide array of challenges that negatively affected their attitudes and views toward online teaching, and that the support received did not parallel their expectations. Teachers' experiences, self-efficacy, and technological competency slightly enhanced their views of online teaching but were not sufficient to shift their mindset. Recommendations include effective professional development initiatives and support for teachers to facilitate teachers' transition and enhance their personal views toward online teaching.","DeCoito, Isha Estaiteyeh, Mohammed",,"DeCoito, I Estaiteyeh, M",340,"[DeCoito, Isha; Estaiteyeh, Mohammed] Western Univ, Fac Educ, 1137 Western Rd, London, ON N6G 1G7, Canada.",Western University (University of Western Ontario),,,,,2025-01-19,Emergency remote teaching; Self-efficacy; Science; technology; engineering; and mathematics (STEM) education; Technological competence,10.1007/s10956-022-09958-z,Article,MAR 2022,1573-1839,idecoito@uwo.ca; mestaite@uwo.ca,356,,,,0N3UX,PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; EFFICACY; MATHEMATICS; ACHIEVEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; MOTIVATION; ADVANTAGES; ATTITUDES; NEEDS,3,J SCI EDUC TECHNOL,J.

"STEM clubs, often located in extracurricular settings, are designed to promote engagement and enjoyment of STEM-related topics and concepts. Given the current policy landscape, a closer examination of STEM clubs is warranted. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges presented by these programs by drawing on interviews with nine STEM club providers in Queensland, a state in north-eastern Australia. The study aims to elucidate the key elements perceived to contribute to the effectiveness and success of STEM clubs, whether school-based, library-based, or run by private businesses for profit. Through inductive thematic analysis, three prominent themes emerged: visioning, pedagogical design and intent, and facilitation. The analysis reveals that Queensland's STEM club context presents significant opportunities for authentic STEM learning and teaching, however, it also identifies challenges to be addressed, including recruiting facilitators who possess expertise in STEM knowledge and skills, possess the necessary confidence and ability to design and implement STEM activities, while also being able to engage and connect with student participants effectively. The findings have implications for STEM-related activities in other informal learning environments.","Fitzgerald, Angela Davis, Kate Leach, Tania Martin, Neil Dunlop, Shelley Bradbury, Ondine Jayne",,"Fitzgerald, A Davis, K Leach, T Martin, N Dunlop, S Bradbury, OJ",,"[Fitzgerald, Angela] RMIT Univ, Sch Educ, Bundoora West Campus Plenty Rd, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia.

"The purpose of this paper is to present an argument for why there is a need to re-envision the underlying culture of undergraduate biology education to ensure the success, retention, and matriculation of Black students. The basis of this argument is the continued noted challenges with retaining Black students in the biological sciences coupled with existing research that implicates science contexts (i.e., the cultural norms, values, and beliefs manifesting through policies and practices) as being the primary source of the challenges experienced by Black students that lead to their attrition. In presenting this argument, we introduce the Re-Envisioning Culture Network, a multigenerational, interdisciplinary network comprised of higher education administrators, faculty, staff, Black undergraduate students majoring in biology, Black cultural artists, community leaders, and STEM professionals to work together to curate and generate resources and tools that will facilitate change. In introducing the REC Network and disseminating its mission and ongoing endeavors, we generate a clarion call for educators, researchers, STEM professionals, students, and the broader community to join us in this endeavor in fostering transformative change.","Morton, Terrell R.

"Despite the widely accepted view that low self-efficacy beliefs negatively influence students' intention to opt for a STEM field oriented study or career path, it remains unclear how to effectively stimulate these beliefs in students who do seem to have the ability and motivation to opt for a STEM career. A suggestion from previous literature is that students' implicit beliefs about the malleability of their learning ability can have a major impact on their self-efficacy beliefs, and, importantly, that these implicit beliefs are malleable themselves. Even though this relation between implicit beliefs, self-efficacy, and STEM field aspirations has been suggested multiple times, there is no empirical evidence to support this claim. The goal of the current study was to examine whether implicit beliefs about the malleability of STEM ability are associated with secondary school students' intention to opt for a STEM field bachelor's degree, using a Structural Equation Modelling approach. Furthermore, we examined the mediating role of STEM-oriented self-efficacy beliefs on the relationship between implicit ability beliefs and STEM intention. We used a Likert-type questionnaire, consisting of subscales to measure ability beliefs, self-efficacy, and intention to opt for a STEM degree of secondary school students in their fifth grade (n = 483). Results showed that there is a positive relation between implicit STEM ability beliefs and the intention to opt for a STEM field bachelor degree, and that this relation is partly mediated by self-efficacy beliefs. Incremental STEM ability beliefs predicted positive self-efficacy beliefs and increased STEM intention. These findings provide a foundation for a novel approach to stimulate and motivate students for the STEM field, namely by stimulating incremental beliefs about their STEM ability.","van Aalderen-Smeets, Sandra I. van der Molen, Juliette H.

"The introduction of Green Chemistry (GC) into school science curriculum is considered an important step that encourages students to build connections between chemistry, other school subjects, and different aspects of their daily lives. The concepts associated with GC can be applied throughout the various levels of education with different degrees of complexity and provide a systematic approach to the teaching of science for sustainability. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the specific content that can be associated with the teaching of GC in primary and secondary schools in Chile. This study aims to provide a model of curricular science content for GC school education, utilizing the framework of Educational Reconstruction. The research question was ""What links do in-service science teachers and science education researchers establish between GC and the school curriculum?"" Specifically, we were interested in comparing science teachers' and science education researchers' perceptions of the links between GC and school science subject, school science contents, and crosscutting science concepts. A qualitative approach was employed for data collection and analysis, focusing on the written responses of 20 in-service science teachers and 20 science education researchers. We conclude the study by proposing an empirically based model of curricular content for GC school education (GCSE), comprising three dimensions: the multidisciplinary dimension of school science subjects represented here by chemistry, with the greatest presence, biology, physics, and geology; the intradisciplinary dimension of core disciplinary contents within each school subject; and the interdisciplinary dimension linked to a range of crosscutting concepts for GC.","Gonzalez-Garcia, Pia Jose Marba-Tallada, Anna Espinet, Mariona",,"González-Garcia, PJ Marbá-Tallada, A Espinet, M",1190,"[Gonzalez-Garcia, Pia Jose; Marba-Tallada, Anna; Espinet, Mariona] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Fac Educ Sci, Dept Didact Math & Expt Sci, Catalonia, Spain.

"Curriculum reform is an important reform for China in the course of its social transformation since its inception in 1996. With curriculum reform as its core, the current education reform has a decade-long history. Internally, the objectives of the current round of education reform by the state government are in support of the 'socialist market economy' and 'the economic development' for the restructuring of the social fabric. Externally, the objective is to enhance the human capital of China in preparation for the new challenges and increasingly fierce competition of the global knowledge-based economy. Senior secondary school education has become the focal point of the current round of reform in basic education. The education reform is also an attempt for the state government to ease some of the pressure brought by the social transformation in areas like the school examination system and employment; to handle social inequalities resulting from economic reforms and others, and to enhance the ethics and values of the next generation, a growing concern in the transformation process. These attempts have created tensions with the objectives of enhancing human capital and economic development. Under such context, the mission of the curriculum reform and the new mechanism of curriculum production imply changes in the way the state produces its core values in school education. This paper examines the 'Phase II Curriculum Reform' in Shanghai and elucidates the tensions among the diverse reform objectives, the underlying concept, institutional design, organization, actual reform outcomes as well as the path of the reform. In so doing, the paper further reveals the predicament that a developing country is currently facing in its education reform.","Luo, Xiaoming",,"Luo, XM",42,,,,"Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA",International Symposium on Education and Cultural Studies,"MAY 22-24, 2008",2025-01-19,curriculum reform; curriculum production mechanism; the nation,10.1080/09502386.2011.534580,Article; Proceedings Paper,,1466-4348,,54,,,,737ID,,1,CULT STUD,Cult.

"However great the optimism in the context - School Education vs. Pandemic COVID-19 - it's necessary to understand the challenges that will be faced in the school educational processes during and after the pandemic, so that communication is careful and subtlety in dealing with school communities, addition to institutional, regulatory and legal reform that will provides for greater investments in infrastructure in education when we talk about Information Technologies. To think that although ""everyone has cell phones"", the internet and the power necessary for remote classes are not in the domain of most young people. The only way to get students and families engaged in this moment is to be calm, caring for others and understanding how the school will behave. We do not have all the answers to solve the great distance between technology and the educational context, but it is already known that we can no longer go back. Technologies are allies of great significance. The following article brings us personal reports from teachers in different contexts and places as well our reflections about how Education is working remotely and the teacher's feelings and perceptions about it. In the last 20 years, although we have available technologies, our focus was still much more in face-to-face classroom lessons and in groups called remote learning, now, in practice, on-line applications and platforms have started to be used in some moments, and teachers and students have been forced to adapt again not only for school education, but also for how they job, to their personal life, for everything.","Ostemberg, Eber Simpioni Carraro, Marcia Regina dos Santos, Pricila Kohls",e-38859,"Ostemberg, E Carraro, MRS dos Santos, PK",,"[Ostemberg, Eber; Simpioni Carraro, Marcia Regina] Univ Catolica Brasilia UCB, Educ, Programa Posgrad Educ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.

"The purpose of the article is to analyse the activities of Stepan Shakh as the director of the Przemysl State Gymnasium, to outline the main areas of the school administration under his chairmanship. The research methodology is based on the principles of historicism, the use of general scientific (generalization, typology) and special scientific research methods, in particular comparative and historical, historical and systemic, critical analysis of sources. The Scientific Novelty of the Research. On the basis of a complex analysis of the memories of the figures who worked and studied at the Przemysl Gymnasium during the outlined period, the main directions of Stepan Shakh's administrative work as the director of the educational institution have been highlighted. In particular, the main reorganization steps in connection with the reform of school education have been defined. The focus is on the development of cultural and educational, national and sports life of students. Based on the studied materials of the press and historiography, the authors came to the conclusions: Stepan Shakh, as the director of the Przemysl Gymnasium, managed to establish the educational process in accordance with the school education reforms of the 1930s. The director responded to the challenges of the times and introduced a number of innovations related to the professional and technical specialization of education (opened workshops, driving courses, etc.), continued the development of traditional educational areas. The head of the gymnasium cooperated with the Ukrainian public figures of the region, the society of parents and graduates, who supported charitable initiatives, cultural, sports and spiritual life of the gymnasium students.","Kovaliv, Yurii Artymyshyn, Yuliia",,"Kovaliv, Y Artymyshyn, Y",118,"[Kovaliv, Yurii; Artymyshyn, Yuliia] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, I Krypiakevych Inst Ukrainian Studies, Dept Conorary Hist, 4 Kozelnytska St, UA-79026 Lvov, Ukraine.","National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; I.

"We report a novel proposal for reducing the digital divide in rural multigrade schools, incorporating knowledge of robotics with a STEM approach to simultaneously promote curricular learning in mathematics and science in several school grades. We used an exploratory qualitative methodology to implement the proposal with 12 multigrade rural students. We explored the contribution of the approaches to the promotion of curricular learning in mathematics and science and the perceptions of using robotics to learn mathematics and science. As data collection techniques, we conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with the participants and analyzed their responses thematically. We concluded that the proposal could contribute to meeting the challenges of multigrade teaching. Our findings suggest that the proposal would simultaneously promote the development of curricular learning in mathematics and science in several school grades, offering an alternative for addressing various topics with different degrees of depth.","Castro, Angela Medina, Jhonny Aguilera, Cristhian A.

"Early science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning experiences often exclude children with disabilities and intersecting identities. To promote learning in STEM for all children, the Curriculum Research Framework (CRF) was applied to build learning trajectories of STEM for children from birth to age 5. The CRF was extended and enhanced to generate explicitly inclusive learning trajectories for children with and without disabilities. The process of generating a priori foundations, building learning trajectories, and testing the results in inclusive settings led to new resources for early childhood education (ECE) and early childhood special education (ECSE) practitioners and generated implications for creating and evaluating learning trajectories in ways that affirm that all children belong in STEM. Challenges faced and lessons learned in this process are presented to guide future research and development using the revised and enhanced CRF.","Guss, Shannon Stark Lim, Chih-Ing Clements, Douglas H.

"In June 2005, three State University of New York (SUNY) campuses, namely Stony Brook University, the University at Buffalo, and Binghamton University, joined forces to provide a completely online electrical engineering program that would lead to a bachelor of science in electrical engineering (BSEE) degree. The program was put together to serve a nontraditional student body that is otherwise unable to achieve higher education in electrical engineering. The project was jump-started by an award from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. This multi-institutional approach was an effective medium for sharing the resources and revenue of the online offering of courses. The Sloan Foundation grant initiated a big step toward the ""Learning Anywhere, Anytime"" vision for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. It helped to set up the infrastructure of an ambitious joint venture among the three SUNY campuses to collaborate on a jointly offered program.","Tang, Wendy Djuric, Petar M.",,"Tang, W Djuric, PM",115,"[Tang, Wendy; Djuric, Petar M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.

"Information graphics such as plots, maps, plans, charts, tables and diagrams form an integral part of the student learning experience in many disciplines. However, for a vision impaired student accessing such graphical materials can be problematic. This research seeks to understand the current state of accessible graphics provision in Australian higher education. We conducted an online survey of 71 vision-impaired university students and semi-structured interviews with 44 key stakeholders (students, academics, disability liaison officers and accessible graphics providers). We found that difficulty in accessing graphical materials was a barrier to many vision-impaired students and that there were systemic problems with current processes for accessible graphics provision.

"The development of skills related to computer programming and robotics and the introduction of computational thinking principles in high schools are worldwide trends today. An effective way of initiating young students in this world consists in proposing them stimulating challenges. This work presents a robotic platform that has been successfully used to develop a competition (called Drone Challenge) in which students had to program the navigation system for a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle (or drone). Both the competition and the supporting platform are described in detail. In particular, the article provides a deep technical description of the main components of the platform, namely the drone simulator and the navigation development framework. The results of the survey conducted after the challenge point to the suitability of the working platform deployed.","Bermudez, Aurelio Casado, Rafael Fernandez, Guillermo Guijarro, Maria Olivas, Pablo",1729881418820425,"Bermúdez, A Casado, R Fernández, G Guijarro, M Olivas, P",,"[Bermudez, Aurelio; Casado, Rafael; Fernandez, Guillermo; Guijarro, Maria; Olivas, Pablo] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Albacete Res Inst Informat, Comp Syst Dept, Campus Univ, Albacete, Spain.",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,,,,,2025-01-19,Engineering education; computational thinking; K-12 education; STEM education; ICT/computing skills; educational robotics,10.1177/1729881418820425,Article,,,aurelio.bermudez@uclm.es,,,MINECO/FEDER [TIN2015-66972-C5-2-R],"The author(s) disclosed the receipt of following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work has been partially supported by the TIN2015-66972-C5-2-R (MINECO/FEDER) project.",HH1KR,COMPUTATIONAL THINKING,1,INT J ADV ROBOT SYST,Int.

"Student engagement and learning in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields in primary and secondary schools is increasingly being emphasized as the importance of STEM skills for future careers is realized. Localized learning has been identified as a group of pedagogical approaches that may enhance learning in STEM by making the relevance of STEM clear to students and providing stronger connections to students' lives and contexts. This paper reports on a scoping review that was conducted to identify the benefits and limitations of localized learning in primary and secondary school STEM disciplines. A secondary aim of the review was to identify strategies that increase the effectiveness of localized learning these disciplines. Following literature searches of four databases, 1923 articles were identified. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Potential benefits of localized learning included increases in enjoyment of STEM, improvements in learning, more positive STEM career aspirations, and development of transferable skills. The main challenges of these pedagogical approaches were time restrictions and lack of community involvement. Strategies for enhancing the impact of localized pedagogy included professional development for teachers (in STEM content knowledge, integration of localized pedagogy, and capacity to address socio-scientific issues), integration of technology, whole-school implementation of the pedagogical approach, and integration of the wider community into STEM education. These findings provide support for localized learning as an effective pedagogical approach to enhance STEM learning in schools, while emphasizing the critical roles of teachers and communities in supporting students to realize the relevance of STEM in their lives.","Holmes, Kathryn Mackenzie, Erin Berger, Nathan Walker, Michelle",,"Holmes, K Mackenzie, E Berger, N Walker, M",,"[Holmes, Kathryn; Mackenzie, Erin; Berger, Nathan; Walker, Michelle] Western Sydney Univ, Ctr Educ Res, Penrith, NSW, Australia.",Western Sydney University,,,,,2025-01-19,stem education; localized pedagogy; contextualized curriculum; scoping review; student engagement,10.3389/feduc.2021.693808,Review,,2504-284X,k.holmes@westernsydney.edu.au,,,,,UO8TI,SCIENCE; EDUCATION; PLACE; ENGAGEMENT; LITERACY,,FRONT EDUC,Front.

"Virtual collaboration tools have become increasingly important in STEM education, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. These tools offer many benefits, including developing 21st-century skills and fostering scientific process skills and scientific creativity. However, there are concerns regarding their effectiveness across different genders and regions. This study evaluates the impact of the ExxonMobil Young Engineers (EYE) program, which uses the Zoom application, on enhancing 21stcentury skills, scientific process skills, and scientific creativity among secondary school students in Malaysia. The participants primarily consist of 520 secondary school students, with teachers acting as facilitators and professional engineers from ExxonMobil serving as instructors. A pre-test survey was conducted to assess students' initial skill levels. The program consisted of three phases: briefing, breakout room activities, and final reflections. After the program, a post-test survey was conducted to evaluate changes in student skills. Data analysis was analyzed using SPSS software by employing descriptive statistics, MANOVA with Wilks' lambda, one-way ANOVA, and partial eta squared to measure the program's impact and the influence of gender and regional factors. The results showed significant improvements in all three skill areas post-intervention: 21st-century skills, scientific process skills, and scientific creativity. Gender differences were significant for 21st-century skills, while regional differences significantly affected scientific process skills. The EYE program could enhance students' STEM-related skills using virtual collaboration tools like Zoom. However, regional and gender differences highlight the importance of adapting programs to address specific challenges and ensuring equitable opportunities for all students.","Jalaludin, Nur Atiqah Salim, Mohamad Hidir Mhd Rasul, Mohamad Sattar Amin, Athirah Farhana Muhammad Saari, Mohd Aizuddin",,"Jalaludin, NA Salim, MHM Rasul, MS Amin, AFM Saari, MA",1340,"[Jalaludin, Nur Atiqah; Rasul, Mohamad Sattar; Saari, Mohd Aizuddin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Educ, STEM Enculturat Res Ctr, Bangi, Malaysia.

"Programming and automation continue to evolve rapidly and advance the capabilities of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. However, physical computing (the integration of programming and interactive physical devices) integrated within biomedical contexts remains an area of limited focus in secondary STEM education programs. As this is an emerging area, many educators may not be well prepared to teach physical computing concepts within authentic biomedical contexts. This shortcoming provided the rationale for this study, to examine if professional development (PD) had a noticeable influence on high school science and technology and engineering (T&E) teachers' (1) perceptions of teaching biomedical and computational thinking (CT) concepts and (2) plans to integrate physical computing within the context of authentic biomedical engineering challenges. The findings revealed a significant difference in the amount of biomedical and CT concepts that teachers planned to implement as a result of the PD. Using a modified version of the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI-A) Riggs and Enochs in Science Education,74(6), 625-637 (1990), analyses revealed significant gains in teachers' self-efficacy toward teaching both biomedical and CT concepts from the PD. Further analyses revealed that teachers reported increases in their perceived knowledge of biomedical and CT concepts and a significant increase in their intent to collaborate with a science or T&E educator outside of their content area. This study provides implications for researchers and educators to integrate more biomedical and physical computing instruction at the secondary education level.","Love, Tyler S. Cysyk, Joshua P.

"Some of the key challenges for STEM education in Turkey include the problems encountered by teachers when integrating diverse disciplines and technologies into STEM activities, the need for teachers to acquire the skills necessary to prepare and implement appropriate STEM activities for the educational level of their students and their school context, the difficulties faced by teachers when following the Engineering Design (ED) problem-solving process in the implementation of STEM activities, and teachers' heavy workloads, which impede the collaboration required to develop and implement STEM activities. A field study was carried out in Samsun, Turkey between 2017 and 2018 to develop a Design Thinking (DT) approach customized to support STEM teachers. The field study adopted an action research methodology and involved two main studies with fifth-grade teachers and students, facilitated by a researcher-designer. Qualitative methods including co-design workshops, focus groups, interviews, and observation were employed to gather data. The paper presents a seven-step DT approach, customized to support pre-service and in-service secondary school teachers in collaboratively designing and implementing classroom STEM activities. The results indicate that structuring the STEM activity design as a specialized DT process provides a complementary framework. Collaboration among teachers in a structured STEM activity design process supports the integration of disciplines and the development of STEM activities that correspond to the students' level of knowledge and ability. Empathy building, which facilitates familiarization with other teachers and students, enhances collaboration among teachers and aids the development of STEM activities relevant to the students' level.","Ozturk, Ahsen Korkut, Fatma",,"Öztürk, A Korkut, F",1409,"[Ozturk, Ahsen] Kutahya Dumlupinar Univ, Ind Design Dept, Kutahya, Turkey.

"In this conceptual study, we explore the incorporation of computational thinking (CT) within integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, aiming to enhance the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework for teacher professional development. Despite the fundamental role of mathematics in K-16 and engineering education, its theoretical and practical dimensions in a transdisciplinary STEM context and its interlinks with CT remain underexplored. This gap extends to the professional development of teachers in research-oriented STEM environments, which presents significant challenges. The study aims to address these issues by repositioning cognitive-adaptive competencies such as CT and design thinking (DT) as a crucial enabler for STEM teacher professional competency, advocating for a move beyond normative approaches. We comprehensively analyze the integration efforts of CT in STEM, which often rely on declarative definitions without substantive practical implications. The study poses questions on (1) how CT can be effectively integrated into STEM, (2) the characteristics of the normative-adaptive model for teacher education, and (3) the development of a conceptual educational framework focused on mathematical modeling, simulation design, and student engagement in research. Drawing on innovative educational practices, we scrutinize the integration of CT and DT through examples from mathematics, emphasizing the importance of developing computational models and algorithms. Ultimately, we propose a competency-centered normative-adaptive-context aware model of STEM integration (NACAMS)-TPACK model that enhances the classical TPACK framework by interlinking computational, design, and general pedagogical competencies. This study is particularly relevant for educators, policymakers, and researchers involved in K-16 STEM and engineering education.","Dolgopolovas, Vladimiras Dagiene, Valentina",,"Dolgopolovas, V Dagiene, V",,"[Dolgopolovas, Vladimiras; Dagiene, Valentina] Vilnius Univ, Inst Data Sci & Digital Technol, Akad Str 4, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania.",Vilnius University,,,,,2025-01-19,computational thinking; design thinking; STEM education; teacher professional development; TPACK framework,10.1002/cae.22788,Review,AUG 2024,1099-0542,vdolgopolovas@gmail.com,,,,,L7V6H,PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; COMPUTING EDUCATION; SCIENCE; MATHEMATICS; DESIGN; FRAMEWORK,6,COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC,Comput.

"This paper aims at exploring the issues related to implementing a formative assessment model namely School-Based Assessment (SBA) at secondary schools in Bangladesh. A qualitative study employing interviews with English teachers of grade 8 and the head teachers and FGDs with students from twelve secondary schools was conducted. Moreover, field notes and document analysis provided valuable data. The findings from the qualitative content analysis showed a dismal condition of implementing SBA in Bangladesh. Some distinct reasons posed challenges to implementing SBA. These are teachers' insufficient orientation towards SBA, teachers' negative attitude towards SBA, teachers' heavy workloads, large class size, large contents of syllabus, no reflection of the marks of SBA in public examinations, lack of honesty and fairness in teachers, lack of validity and reliability of SBA as an assessment tool, poor socio-economic conditions of teachers, and the absence of monitoring and supervision by concerned authorities. This study also provides a comprehensive understanding of how teachers conceptualize and apply strategies of SBA in their classrooms, along with some recommendations and, hence, bears implications for the policy makers, teacher trainers, and other stakeholders involved in the Bangladeshi school education system and elsewhere.","Rahman, Kh.

"Rapport has been recognized as important in learning in general but little is known about its importance in distance education (DE). The study we report on in this paper provides insights into the importance of rapport in DE as well as challenges to and indicators of rapport-building in DE. The study relied on interviews with 42 Canadian high-school DE teachers. Findings revealed that rapport is necessary in DE because of the absence of face-to-face communication. Challenges to building rapport relate to the geographic dispersion of students, the asynchronous nature of DE, teacher workload, limits of the software, teachers and students not seeing the need for rapport, and DE traditions. We identified six categories of rapport-building in DE as follows: Recognizing the person/individual; Supporting and monitoring; Availability, accessibility, and responsiveness; Non text-based interactions; Tone of interactions; Non-academic conversation/interactions. We break the categories into subcategories and provide indicators for each one. The indicators might also be used in contexts of DE teacher professional development as a springboard for discussion, or, more prescriptively, as guides to DE teacher behaviour. A follow-up study using a more fine-grained focus on specific indicators might provide insights into specific rapport-related behaviours.","Murphy, Elizabeth Rodriguez-Manzanares, Maria A.",,"Murphy, E Rodríguez-Manzanares, MA",167,"[Murphy, Elizabeth; Rodriguez-Manzanares, Maria A.] Mem Univ, St John, NF, Canada.",Memorial University Newfoundland,,,,,2025-01-19,Distance education; online learning; rapport; teachers' beliefs; high school education,10.19173/irrodl.v13i1.1057,Article,,,,190,,,,984UU,JUDGMENT; STUDENT,1,INT REV RES OPEN DIS,Int.

"Classroom response technologies commonly called ""clickers"" have been a popular tool for teaching in many disciplines, even required by some courses. Despite this excitement and corresponding investment in clicker technology, scholars disagree on the value of clickers. To help support teachers who utilize or are interested in using clickers, we explore the past, present, and future of clickers in education. This manuscript provides a literature review of how clickers are used, the benefits and challenges, and suggestions on the implementation of clicker technologies. Utilizing five research databases and a wide range of search terms, two general trends for clicker use became apparent: traditional classrooms that use clickers to enhance them and classrooms integrating clickers with more novel pedagogical approaches. After separating the papers into groups based on the trend they follow, the benefits and challenges were identified and recorded. In turn, we summarize what research has to say regarding both teachers and students for each of these primary outcomes. Building off clicker research both past and present, this review then looks toward the future by providing suggestions for overcoming the challenges faced by students and teachers when using clickers. Furthermore, we recommend important directions to consider for future research on clickers, including the need for more empirical studies of how different uses of clickers can benefit different learners in increasingly equitable ways.","Henderson, J.

"The initial training of teachers assumes great responsibility in the methodological renewal of teachers. This study aims to know the thinking of higher education students, future teachers, regarding their knowledge and attitudes towards the curricular integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), as well as to identify inhibiting and propelling factors of the use of digital technology by future teachers. This study is part of the IFITIC Project, which aims to rethink educational practice with ICT in the initial training of future teachers in order to promote methodological renewal in Pre-school Education and the 1st and 2nd Cycles of Basic Education. We used the methodological design survey and for data collection we applied a questionnaire survey, with closed questions, to students of Basic Education and Vocational Master's degree from two public higher education institutions in the North of Portugal. The results point to the existence of inhibiting factors such as lack of resources in training centers, and propellants to ICT integration such as the availability of personal resources that can compensate for the lack of resources in school centers and ICT training by training schools. They also reveal a positive and open attitude on the part of students towards the educational use of ICT.","Graca, Vania Quadros-Flores, Paula Ramos, Altina",,"Graça, V Quadros-Flores, P Ramos, A",85,"[Graca, Vania] Univ Minho, Educ Sci, Educ Technol, Braga, Portugal.

"The learning of mathematics poses specific linguistic challenges. Amongst them, teachers and students need to be able to unpack the language used in mathematics word problems to understand its context, discern the relationships between the known and unknown information, and identify relevant solution strategies. Prior research has described some of the linguistic complexities within the math discipline. However, research has not yet examined the linguistic patterns of additive problem types in particular, nor explored how linguistic analysis might be applied to support prospective elementary teachers in making sense of these problems. Using a corpus of 400 word problems, the authors conducted an ideation analysis, drawing from Systemic Functional Linguistics theory. The findings resulted in a distillation of language features key to conveying the mathematical meanings in the three types of additive problems (i.e., change, part-part-whole, and additive comparison). Prospective elementary teachers were introduced to linguistic functional metalanguage as a tool for analyzing the key language features in additive word problems. Analysis of their work demonstrated their ability to employ the functional metalanguage to identify challenges and describe specific linguistic characteristics associated with each type of additive problem.","Kwok, Michelle Welder, Rachael M.

"The current educational process faces multiple challenges, as it deals with relationships and with multiple intelligences. School education participates in these challenges. How to educate for the tolerance and social responsibility, taking into account the construction of a culture of peace, respect and care towards the difference? How could the discipline of Religious Education actively participate in the process of human formation? This study is part of a broader research on tolerance and promotion of a culture of peace in some public elementary schools in the suburbs of the city of Belo Horizonte / MG. Based on bibliographic and observational research, the study aims to conceive a pedagogical action with a dialogical focus. This action was called ""pedagogy of care and knowledge"", since affection and knowledge need to coexist in the school environment to encourage constructive relationships. This reflection aims to present the results of the aforementioned research and propose care in interpersonal relationships, so that the school reaches desirable quality level, both at the intellectual and emotional levels. Dialogical relationships are built on valuing the human and for this very reason they remain. The exercise of interreligious dialogue in the school environment can be an opportunity and training in dialogical constructions, both by participating in school projects and in their development inside the classroom.","Panasiewicz, Roberlei",,"Panasiewicz, R",174,"[Panasiewicz, Roberlei] Pontificia Univ Catolica Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Minas Gerais,,,,,2025-01-19,Care; Knowledge; Education; Dialogical Relationship,10.5752/P.2175-5841.2020v18n55p174,Article,,2175-5841,roberlei@pucminas.br,196,,,,OG8UE,,55,HORIZONTE,Horizonte,Portuguese,,27,gold,,"RUA PADRE PEDRO EVANGELISTA 377, BELO HORIZONTE, 30535-490, BRAZIL",JAN-APR,23,BELO HORIZONTE,,,J,EDITORA PUC MINAS,2020,,"Panasiewicz, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",Religion,,1679-9615,HORIZONTE-REVISTA DE ESTUDOS DE TEOLOGIA E CIENCIAS DA RELIGIAO,,,0,Care and knowledge: human formation and dialogical relationship in educational environments,0,1,WOS:000582151100010,18,,Religion,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),0
"Collaborations and partnerships across disciplines are becoming increasingly recognized as valuable endeavors toward solving emerging global challenges in our rapidly changing world. Thus, it is crucial to create STEM educational strategies that infuse diverse and interconnected perspectives among scientists, policymakers, and the general public. Systems thinking represents one such pedagogical approach, in which a holistic framework empowers both teachers and students to recognize how fundamental concepts taught in the classroom can be used as resourceful tools to better address complex, multicomponent modern challenges. For chemical educators, topics on technology (the ""T"" in STEM education) represent a particularly meaningful avenue to introduce and study the effectiveness of systems thinking, but there have been few examples reported to date. Here, we show that a molecular engineering course introduced at the University of Chicago 5 years ago (""Introduction to Emerging Technologies"") provides a model course to this end, where explicitly designing in elements of systems thinking to the course could further strengthen students' understanding of the already well suited, holistic course topics. Integrating systems thinking would illuminate how tissue engineering, nanomedicine, batteries, quantum information, and meat alternatives are developed from multiple, interrelated fields as well as from basic science to a practical reality. For each technology, we outline the direct connections between the current course topics and future opportunities to incorporate systems thinking strategies, challenging students to identify the interdependence of components in a successful technology. Finally, to offer further insight for instructors interested in utilizing systems thinking, we broaden our discussion to reflect on the challenges of redesigning any STEM course to utilize systems thinking, and we present corresponding teaching strategies to overcome them.","Fowler, Whitney C.

"BackgroundThis study posits that scaffolded team-based computational modeling and simulation projects can support model-based learning that can result in evidence of representational competence and regulatory skills. The study involved 116 students from a second-year thermodynamics undergraduate course organized into 24 teams, who worked on three two-week-long team-based computational modeling and simulation projects and reflected upon their experience.ResultsResults characterized different levels of engagement with computational model-based learning in the form of problem formulation and model planning, implementation and use of the computational model, evaluation, and interpretation of the outputs of the model, as well as reflection on the process. Results report on students' levels of representational competence as related to the computational model, meaning-making of the underlying code of the computational model, graphical representations generated by the model, and explanations and interpretations of the output representations. Results also described regulatory skills as challenges and strategies related to programming skills, challenges and strategies related to meaning-making skills for understanding and connecting the science to the code and the results, and challenges and strategies related to process management mainly focused on project management skills.ConclusionCharacterizing dimensions of computational model-based reasoning provides insights that showcase students' learning, benefits, and challenges when engaging in team-based computational modeling and simulation projects. This study also contributes to evidence-based scaffolding strategies that can support undergraduate students' engagement in the context of computational modeling and simulation.","Magana, Alejandra J.

"Background Medical informed consent stands as an ethical and legal requisite preceding any medical intervention. Hospitalized patients face functional health literacy (FHL) challenges when dealing with informed consent forms (ICFs). The legitimacy of ICFs and informed consent procedures in China remains substantially undisclosed. The study's aim was to investigate if Chinese patients have adequate FHL to be truly informed before providing medical consent. Methods In this cross-sectional, structured interview-based study, FHL was assessed within the context of the informed consent scenarios in two teaching hospitals (a 1500-bed general tertiary hospital and a 700-bed cancer hospital) affiliated with Shantou University Medical College. Twenty-seven patients admitted across clinical departments, along with their relatives (n = 59), were enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent. The participants underwent a three-step assessment with two selected ICFs -teach-back skills, perceived understanding (perception), and informed knowledge (cognizance), with each component carrying a maximum score of 10. Data were analyzed with SPSS (version 22.0) for descriptive and inferential statistics, with consideration of significant P values as < 0.05. Results The median age (IQR and range) of participants was 35.5 (28 - 49 and 13 - 74) years. Most participants had only high school education (24.4%, 21/86) or below high school education (47.7%, 41/86). The median score (IQR) of FHL assessments-teach-back, perception, and cognizance-was 4.0 (2.5, 5.8), 8.0 (6.8, 8.8), and 6.5 (5.5, 8.0) out of 10, respectively. A moderate correlation was observed between the scores of cognizance and teach-back (r = 0.359, P = 0.002) or perception (r = 0.437, P < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis predicted being a patient and having lower education levels as independent risk factors of inadequate FHL (Ps = 0.001). Lack of patient-centeredness in ICFs, time constraints, and poor clinical communication were identified as barriers impeding informed consent. Conclusions This study demonstrates inadequacy in personal FHL and impaired organizational HL, resulting in compromised informed consent in Chinese teaching hospitals. As a remedy, we propose improving the quality of ICFs and institutionally mandated outcome-focused training on informed consent for all concerned clinicians to enhance medical ethics, ensure quality health care, address patient values, and mitigate potential medical conflicts.","Zhang, Dangui Hu, Zhilin Wu, Zhuojia Huang, Ting Huang, Tingting Liu, Junhao Sun, Hongkun Ba-Thein, William",91,"Zhang, DG Hu, ZL Wu, ZJ Huang, T Huang, TT Liu, JH Sun, HK Ba-Thein, W",,"[Zhang, Dangui] Shantou Univ Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 2, Res Ctr Translat Med, Shantou, Peoples R China.

"Indigenous populations, constituting 6.2% of the global population, face challenges in STEM education due to systemic barriers and limited exposure to science and engineering. Our research, part of a federally funded project, aimed to address these challenges by implementing Community-Based Engineering (CBE) education in an elementary school located on a Native American Reservation in the United States. In this paper, we used CBE as our theoretical framework situating engineering within the context of students' communities and cultures. Our participants included 15 students and two Native American teachers with varying teaching experience. We employed mixed methods and combined quantitative tools such as the Engineering Identity Development Scale and the Engineering & Technology subscale of the S-STEM survey, with qualitative data from teacher and student interviews. Our analysis revealed significant changes in students' perceptions of engineering for their communities and their personal engineering identities after they engaged with CBE lessons. We also found that the cultural connections to community were evident in student interviews. Furthermore, teachers appreciated CBE and emphasized that these engineering lessons enrich their rich traditions and practices. This study highlights the effectiveness of CBE and demonstrates how engineering education can be more inclusive and resonant with Indigenous students.","Boz, Tugba Hammack, Rebekah Lux, Nicholas Gannon, Paul",,"Boz, T Hammack, R Lux, N Gannon, P",,"[Boz, Tugba; Hammack, Rebekah] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.

"Today's society faces new challenges, especially related to sustainability, in which the role of science within society is becoming increasingly important. This study seeks to re-examine the focus of school science/STEM education in light of increasing societal challenges by introducing a trans-contextualisation component within science education so as to go beyond the classroom and seek to impact the societal setting. In so doing, this study, through a constructivism-humanism approach, develops a theoretical 4-phase model by adding a trans-contextualisation learning phase to a literature-supported 3-stage science education teaching model. This enhanced model is put forward to enable science education to play a stronger role in impacting societal development towards building an active informed citizenry, enabling society to reflect on potential ways to meet its needs in moving towards a sustainable future. The study seeks science educator views familiar with the 3-stage teaching approach on the enhanced 4-phase model in terms of its value, feasibility and potential constraints. Such views are shown to be positive and aligned with the generally supportive views of teachers identified in a prior study.","Holbrook, Jack Chowdhury, T. B. M.

"This is a story of critical participation in engineering and applied science spaces that examines the challenges and opportunities of STS (Science and Technology Studies) experiments in relation to disciplinary identity, institutional values, and the power dynamics at work in the experiment. Comparing my experiences as an STS graduate student negotiating access in a research-oriented nanoengineering department geared toward capital formation, and as an assistant professor in a teaching-oriented applied science department geared toward holistic problem-solving, I highlight the necessity of creating mutual benefit and shared interest for STS approaches to gain traction in these spaces. At the same time, I describe the ways that institutional imperatives and power dynamics enable and constrain the possibilities for doing so. I argue that making STS relevant in STEM spaces requires paying close attention to the language through which scientists and engineers express their perspectives, values, and challenges, and it requires exercising a level of opportunism in identifying ways to make STS insights visible and legitimate. Teaching in a multidisciplinary curriculum builds on shared interest in education, potentially enabling disparate perspectives to come into dialogue as part of mutual world-building.","York, Emily",,"York, E",66,"[York, Emily] James Madison Univ, Sch Integrated Sci, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",James Madison University,,,,,2025-01-19,STS; making and doing; STEM education; cultures of science and engineering; critical participation,10.1080/19378629.2018.1447576,Article,,1940-8374,yorker@jmu.edu,84,,,,GI5WL,ENGINEERING-EDUCATION; PERSPECTIVE; SCHOLARSHIP,1,ENG STUD,Eng.

"Mathematical modeling is a high-leverage topic; it is critical to students' participation in STEM education and supports civic engagement. Until recently, research on modeling at the elementary level has been underemphasized, particularly research on supports and challenges for teachers who engage in designing authentic modeling tasks. In this study, we employed qualitative case study methods to investigate how elementary teachers designed and implemented authentic mathematical modeling tasks, with an explicit focus on how their tasks evidenced different dimensions of authenticity. We analyzed three cases of teams of elementary teachers as they developed modeling tasks connected to school and community contexts. The three cases were: 1) a student-driven modeling task related to paper and plastic waste in a school cafeteria, 2) a modeling task based on authentic situations at a community-run resource center, and 3) a modeling task focused on designing and monitoring a school community-building art project. Our cases illustrate that elementary teachers can successfully design and implement modeling activities that utilize different entry points and evidence multiple dimensions of authenticity. Furthermore, we found that the specific dimensions of authenticity may vary depending on the design supports and curriculum challenges within each context.","Turner, Erin E.

"Prior literature suggests that teaching corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability has led to little development of students' reflexive engagement with the challenges of sustainable development. To shed light on this criticism, we apply sensemaking-as entailing the three stages of scanning for information, interpreting it and identifying alternatives of action-to CSR/sustainability education. Analysing cognitive maps of CSR, drawn by undergraduate finalists from a UK business school, we find that students are able to produce complex cognitive maps in terms of scanning for information; however, cognitive bottlenecks occur at the second and third stages of sensemaking. A key pedagogical challenge is, therefore, to support students in moving beyond scanning towards developing meaning and acting on that basis. By introducing a sensemaking lens, we add to a deeper understanding of the complexities associated with CSR education as it aids (or impedes) critical engagement and action.","Preuss, Lutz Fischer, Isabel Luiz, John M.",,"Preuss, L Fischer, I Luiz, JM",676,"[Preuss, Lutz] KEDGE Business Sch, Talence, France.

"Despite the significant growth and capabilities of mobile technologies, there is limited empirical evidence on teachers' perceived mobile technology-learning barriers. This study investigated Greek teachers' perceptions of barriers to using mobile technology in school classrooms. A 28-item questionnaire was administered to 557 teachers and six barrier-factors were extracted: 'lack of resources', 'lack of support', 'lack of time', 'lack of teacher confidence', 'class conditions' and 'concerns about students'. The questionnaire was a valid and reliable tool for the investigation of various dimensions of teachers' perceived barriers. Gender, school level, age and ICT training had significant but small effects on specific barrier-factors. The order of importance of barrier-factors was similar for users and non-users ('lack of resources', 'support' and 'class conditions') independently of the type of mobile device used in class. 'Concerns about students' was identified as a major barrier only by non-users. Implications for educational policy and professional training are discussed.","Nikolopoulou, Kleopatra Gialamas, Vasilis Lavidas, Konstantinos",,"Nikolopoulou, K Gialamas, V Lavidas, K",29,"[Nikolopoulou, Kleopatra; Gialamas, Vasilis] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Sch Educ, Dept Early Childhood Educ, Navarinou 13A, Athens 10680, Greece.

"The scale of World War I profoundly affected, at all levels, the states involved. Social and cultural life suffered enormously. This paper analyzes the situation of Romanian school education in Transylvania during the Great War. It considers how the hardships of daily life affected school attendance by children and the very functioning of schools. It was obviously a time of great indigence, not only because of the enormous price increases for food and other products. The conscription of the men had a strong negative impact on society, affecting household functionality and hence the living standards. A major issue was the conscription of teachers and professors, creating an unstable situation with a strong impact on education. The sources used for this paper are the Romanian press in Transylvania, memoirs, and archival documents. This study aims to show how Romanian school authorities coped with these challenges in an attempt to keep the schools open, wherever possible.","Marza, Daniela",,"Mârza, D",41,"[Marza, Daniela] Romanian Acad, Ctr Transylvanian Studies, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",Romanian Academy,,,,,2025-01-19,First World War; Romanian schools; Transylvania; Blaj; teachers; pupils,,Article,,,daniela_marza@yahoo.com,47,,,,EJ6WK,,4,TRANSYLV REV,Transylv.

"The study examined the effectiveness of concept mapping in improving students' academic performance using an embedded mixed-methods design. It involved Srinka Secondary School's grade 10 biology teacher, students, and department head in the study and gathered data from them by using biology achievement tests, interviews, and focus group discussions. The collected data was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, and it revealed that concept mapping was more effective in teaching cell division than the lecture method, but challenges include practitioners' lack of background experience, time constraints, students' absenteeism, and weak teacher support, which affected concept mapping implementation. Training practitioners, learners' regular attendance and use of context-based materials, time management, and teachers' artistic teaching approaches were suggested as solution strategies. Therefore, responsible bodies are required to create a conducive instructional environment that can scale up practitioners' concept mapping and practice initiatives.","Abraha, Mollaw",2426109,"Abraha, M",,"[Abraha, Mollaw] Woldia Univ, Dept Pedag Sci, Woldia, Ethiopia.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Concept mapping; effect; gender; science learning; secondary school; Teaching Assistants; Theories of Learning; Classroom Practice; Continuing Professional Development; History of Education; Middle School Education,10.1080/2331186X.2024.2426109,Article,,,mollawabraha09@gmail.com,,,,,L9Z2Z,,1,COGENT EDUC,Cogent Educ.,English,,52,gold,,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",DEC 31,17,ABINGDON,,,J,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,2024,,"Abraha, M (corresponding author), Woldia Univ, Dept Pedag Sci, Woldia, Ethiopia.",Education & Educational Research,,2331-186X,COGENT EDUCATION,,,0,"Effects of concept mapping on students' science learning: secondary schools of Habru Woreda, Amhara Region-Ethiopia",3,3,WOS:001354225600001,11,,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),0
"This study examines the impact that producing a print newspaper using cell phones had on marginalized students in a high school journalism classroom. Analysis of data from participant observation, artifact analysis and student interviews revealed that a) students negotiated cell phone use for educational purposes, despite school bans on such devices, and b) students manifested emerging, transformative identities that positively influenced their roles in five key areas: as a conception of self, in other academic classes, among peers, with family, and in the community. Our findings point to the significance of media-based journalism production in allowing marginalized students to embrace professional identities by participating in a meaningful community of practice. This research highlights the academic, social and civic benefits of such initiatives, and calls attention to the range of opportunities and challenges that pertain to using mobile devices as learning tools in these contexts.","Cybart-Persenaire, Alena Literat, Ioana",,"Cybart-Persenaire, A Literat, I",181,"[Cybart-Persenaire, Alena; Literat, Ioana] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA.",Columbia University; Columbia University Teachers College,,,,,2025-01-19,Journalism; mobile technologies; high school education; marginalization; communities of practice,10.1080/17439884.2018.1458736,Article,,1743-9892,literat@tc.columbia.edu,196,,,,GH3PR,ONLINE NEWSROOMS; COMMUNITIES; NEWS; LITERACIES,2,LEARN MEDIA TECHNOL,Learn.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide information about the extent to which sustainability is integrated into business school education and learning in the Asia Pacific region. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was developed, and administered to business schools in the Asia Pacific region. In addition to measuring the number of courses and programs integrating sustainability, the study solicited qualitative observations by respondents, to provide information and insight into the issues. Findings - The research found that whereas corporate governance, sustainability and business ethics were quite commonly taught in business schools, they were not generally prioritized. There was also an overall lack of systematic approaches to the integration of sustainability in business curricula, and significant barriers to the integration of sustainability into programs remained. Originality/value - This is the first region-wide survey of sustainability in business education in the Asia Pacific region.","Naeem, Malik Neal, Mark",,"Naeem, M Neal, M",60,"[Neal, Mark] Eastern Inst Technol, Sch Business, Napier, New Zealand.

"This paper is an essay on the state of Australian education that frames new directions for educational research. It outlines three challenges faced by Australian educators: highly spatialised poverty with particularly strong mediating effects on primary school education; the need for intellectual and critical depth in pedagogy, with a focus in the upper primary and middle years; and the need to reinvent senior schooling to address emergent pathways from school to work and civic life. It offers a narrative description of the dynamics of policy making in Australia and North America and argues for an evidence-based approach to social and educational policy-but one quite unlike current test and market-based approaches. Instead, it argues for a multidisciplinary approach to a broad range of empirical and case-based evidence that subjects these to critical, hermeneutic social sciences. Such an approach would join educational policy with educational research, and broader social, community and governmental action with the aim of reorganising and redistributing material, cultural and social resources.","Luke, A",,"Luke, A",87,"Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Ctr Res Pedag & Practice, Singapore 637616, Singapore.",Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore,,"BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA",Annual Conference of the Australian-Association-Research-in-Education,"DEC, 2002",2025-01-19,,,Article; Proceedings Paper,,,aluke@nie.edu.sg,107,,,,777CQ,,2,AUST EDUC RES,Aust.

"Humankind is increasingly being challenged by anthropogenic environmental changes and society needs to be better equipped with knowledge, skills and values to adapt to these changes. This poses new challenges for school education. We propose a framework towards future-oriented education by addressing three issues: a) How can the school curriculum be reframed to take account of anthropogenic environmental changes? b) What difficulties do students encounter when learning about these changes? c) What learning tools and pedagogical strategies are best suited to effectively and efficiently teach about environmental changes? An example is provided, whereby secondary school students engage with the topic of deforestation using geospatial technology. This study informs curriculum makers and instructors in providing education that enhances adolescents' understanding of the uncertain world and increases their ability to be proactive, rather than merely responding to change.","Xiang, Xi Meadows, Michael E.",6832,"Xiang, X Meadows, ME",,"[Xiang, Xi; Meadows, Michael E.] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.

"Living in an unpredictable and ever changing society demands from its' citizens the development of complex competencies that challenges school, education and curriculum. PARSEL, a pan-European Project related to science education, emerges as a contribution to curricular development as it proposes a set of teaching-learning materials (modules) in order to make science classes more popular and relevant in the eyes of the students and as such to increase their interest with school science. The goal of this study was to understand how students evaluate those innovative modules. This paper presents data concerning 134 secondary students, collected through interviews, questionnaires and written documents. A quantitative analysis of the data collected through questionnaires was complemented by a qualitative analysis of the data collected by interviews and written documents. Results show that understanding the relationship between science and daily life, participating in practical activities based on problem solving and developing critical thinking and reasoning were the issues most valued by students.","Freire, Sofia Faria, Claudia Galvao, Cecilia Reis, Pedro",,"Freire, S Faria, C Galvao, C Reis, P",163,"[Freire, Sofia; Faria, Claudia; Galvao, Cecilia; Reis, Pedro] Univ Lisbon, Inst Educ, P-1649013 Lisbon, Portugal.",Universidade de Lisboa,,,,,2025-01-19,Students' interest; Science relevance; Science popularity; Science education,10.1007/s11165-011-9247-0,Article,,1573-1898,asraposo@ie.ul.pt; cbfaria@ie.ul.pt; cgalvao@ie.ul.pt; pedrorochareis@netcabo.pt,178,,,,077KY,INQUIRY,1,RES SCI EDUC,Res.

"The attempt based on philosophy of education is made to define the position of psychology in educational process and psychologist's tasks according to the challenges facing education. The main task of school education can be represented as formation of students' broad social orientation in all areas of life. This problem is solved by pedagogical and psychological means; in light of the above practicing psychologist in education is engaged in the formation of students' adequate self-concept, realization of cognitive abilities, emotio-personal features of self and others. P.J. Galperin's general psychological theory of psyche's orienting nature serves as a theory able to solve this problem, thus it acquires the status of the fundamental theory, which has ideological, philosophical significance.

"India has made significant progress in improving the enrolment of students with disability but still has a long way to go before schools can be called inclusive. Despite the widely acknowledged relevance of assessments in shaping teaching and learning practices, little research has been done in disability-inclusive assessment in the Indian setting. In this paper, we explore teachers' perceptions of disability inclusion in formative assessments, including the use of various kinds of accommodations and adaptations, factors that affect the implementation of disability-inclusive formative assessments, and challenges. It is argued that teacher professional development and teacher-parent partnerships are essential for ensuring the inclusion of students with disability in formative assessments. Unless assessment is given its due importance in disability-inclusive education, achievement gaps between children with and without disability may widen due to the unavailability of learning data and its use.","Chakraborty, Anannya Kaushik, Amit Ramachandran, Vimala",,"Chakraborty, A Kaushik, A Ramachandran, V",,"[Chakraborty, Anannya; Kaushik, Amit] Australian Council Educ Res India, New Delhi, India.

The reflections proposed in this text problematize the specificity of pedagogy and how its identity aspects occupy the national discussion amidst reductionisms that link it exclusively to school education, disregarding configurations of action already under way in contexts of emerging challenges for the assurance and expansion of the right to education. In this text, we position ourselves in favor of the place and role that pedagogy has been occupying in society beyond school walls, considering it as a science of and for education.

The advantage of such an autobiographical approach is that it unlocks valuable information, which would otherwise be passed unnoticed, leaving an incomplete if not skewed portrayal of some developments in the past. Part 1 discusses the following aspects: The hardships of life on a small farm in South Africa during the 1920s and 1930s; the difficulty in obtaining thorough school education; the demands of training as a DRC missionary; challenges of running a so-called ""mission congregation"" within the same geographical borders as the sending church or churches; language acquisition in multi-language situations, and the lonely road of improving academic qualifications.","Robinson, P.",,"Robinson, P",81,,,,,,,2025-01-19,,,Article,,,,103,,,,468VI,,1,ACTA THEOL,Acta Theol.,Dutch,,1,,,"PUBLICATIONS OFFICE, UFS-SASOL LIBRARY, PO BOX 301, BLOEMFONTEIN, 9300, SOUTH AFRICA",JUN,23,BLOEMFONTEIN,,,J,"UNIV FREE STATE, FAC THEOLOGY",2009,,"Robinson, P (corresponding author), Posbus 2757, ZA-7551 Durbanville, South Africa.",Religion,,1015-8758,ACTA THEOLOGICA,,,0,"DR.

"Objective: The authors summarize efforts to revitalize psychiatry teaching to medical students at Harvard Medical School (HMS) in advance of a major overhaul of the medical school curriculum. Methods: This preliminary report chronicles key challenges and the organization of the reform effort within the departments of psychiatry affiliated with the medical school. Results: Based upon a comprehensive internal review of psychiatric education at the medical school, the HMS Psychiatry Executive Committee and psychiatry faculty concluded that psychiatry teaching was underresourced and lacked cohesion and consistent standards and expectations across clinical sites involved in psychiatry teaching. Through a willingness to identify and vigorously address deficiencies in medical student education within a large decentralized program, psychiatry has earned a reputation as an effective reform agent at the medical school. Conclusions: Psychiatry education improvements have strengthened our partnership with the medical school as it is undertaking major educational reform of its entire curriculum.","Alpert, JE Schlozman, S Badaracco, MA Burke, J Borus, JF",,"Alpert, JE Schlozman, S Badaracco, MA Burke, J Borus, JF",170,"Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA.

"Rarely do refugee students entering Australian schools possess the multiple forms of social, linguistic and cultural capital that are taken for granted in mainstream classrooms. While refugees of high-school age are assisted initially through Intensive English Centres (IECs), the transition from IECs to mainstream classrooms presents substantial challenges. This paper outlines the perceived impacts of a partnership program known as Refugee Action Support (RAS) that assists secondary school students, predominantly African humanitarian refugees, as they seek to make the transition from IECs to mainstream settings. Implemented by the Australian Literacy and Numeracy Foundation, the University of Western Sydney and the NSW Department of Education and Training, the program is based on school-based tutoring centres that use pre-service teachers as tutors. The paper explores the perceived effects on refugee students participating in RAS from the perspectives of teachers who assist in the coordination of the program at the various school sites.","Ferfolja, Tania Vickers, Margaret",,"Ferfolja, T Vickers, M",149,"[Ferfolja, Tania; Vickers, Margaret] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Educ, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.",Western Sydney University,,,,,2025-01-19,disadvantaged students; refugees; school; support program; tutoring centres,10.1080/17508481003731034,Article,,1750-8495,ta.ferfolja@uws.edu.au,162,,,,V26ZZ,TEACHER-EDUCATION,2,CRIT STUD EDUC,Crit.

"In the neoliberal economic policies adopted by nations, services for social welfare including education are rendered commodities to be purchased by citizens, and the employees' (teachers') skills too get commodified. The pedagogical skills of teachers may often be judged predominantly in terms of their contribution towards ease of profit-making by the private schools rather than facilitating students' learning and growth. Through qualitative autoethnographic analysis of my experiences within private schools as an employee in a major city of Uttar Pradesh state of India, I explore the ways in which commodification of private school education, including teachers' skills and roles, could be potentially dehumanising (being treated as persons unworthy of humanness or care) for teachers. The findings of my autoethnographic analysis point to aspects of such dehumanisation and the challenges ahead for the teachers to work towards making school spaces a growth-inducing experience for students and themselves.","Kukreja, Shilpi",,"Kukreja, S",2037,"[Kukreja, Shilpi] Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj Univ, Sch Arts Humanities & Social Sci, Kanpur, India.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Neoliberalism; dehumanisation; private schools; autoethnography; India,10.1080/09518398.2023.2258110,Article,SEP 2023,1366-5898,shilpi2903@gmail.com,2054,,"I am thankful to Prof. Kumar Ravi Priya, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Kanpur for rekindling within me the hope and promise of qualitative research.

"The COVID-19 outbreak has led to an influx of research studies focusing on the new norm of online teaching-learning in higher education. However, much less is known about how this profound shift in pedagogy has impacted school education especially among rural children of India. The present study is an attempt to understand the barriers and challenges that teachers of Public-funded (PF) elementary schools face while teaching online. We developed a semi-structured questionnaire and administered it to teachers of PF elementary schools in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh, India, using the online survey method. Thematic analysis of the responses we received (N = 203) reveals five broad themes, namely physical environmental constraints, socio-environmental limitations, parental support, issues of effective learning and health and well-being hazards. These findings have several implications for developing appropriate online teaching methods and making policy interventions to enhance learners' as well as educators' experiences.","Singh, Arti Gupta, Kriti Yadav, Vivek Kumar",,"Singh, A Gupta, K Yadav, VK",26,"[Gupta, Kriti] Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur Univ, JP Coll, Dept Psychol, Bhagalpur, Bihar, India.",,,,,,2025-01-19,COVID-19; public-funded schools; online learning; elementary school teachers; rural India,10.1080/03004279.2021.1948091,Article,JUL 2021,1475-7575,kriti.phs13@iitp.ac.in,40,,,,8L2UT,EDUCATION,1,EDUC 3-13,Educ. 3-13,English,,69,Green Submitted,,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",JAN 2,15,ABINGDON,,,J,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",2023,"Singh, Arti/HLX-4417-2023","Gupta, K (corresponding author), Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur Univ, JP Coll, Dept Psychol, Bhagalpur, Bihar, India.",Education & Educational Research,,0300-4279,EDUCATION 3-13,,,10,Adopting e-learning facilities during COVID-19: Exploring perspectives of teachers working in Indian Public-funded Elementary Schools,0,14,WOS:000669110600001,51,,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),12
"This study explores trends in international marriage migration, determinants of international marriage, and factors that affect employment and poverty status of marriage migrant females in Korea. The results suggest that the number of cross-border marriages increased rapidly in the early 2000s but has declined since the mid-2000s, perhaps because of the Korean government's strict regulations and of saturation in the demand for foreign wives. The analysis also indicated that rural males with a graduate degree have a similar probability to urban males with a high-school education. Employment opportunities vary substantially by the foreign wife's country of origin, implying that social policies for addressing the difficulties of multicultural families should be tailored toward specific ethnic groups. Those who participated in work training programmes were significantly more likely to be employed than non-participants, and the size of social support network significantly reduced the odds of living in poverty.","Kim, Keuntae",,"Kim, K",74,"[Kim, Keuntae] Korean Womens Dev Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1111/imig.12331,Article,,1468-2435,,88,,,,EU7AZ,LABOR-FORCE PARTICIPATION; MARRIED-WOMEN; IMMIGRANTS; POVERTY,3,INT MIGR,Int.

"Based on 65 interviews and secondary information, this study evaluated the programme, process and political dimensions of the Ghana Free Senior High School Education (SHS) Policy. The evidence from the data showed that the programme and its political dimensions were emphasised to the neglect of the process dimension. Effectiveness, one of the criteria in the programme dimension, was somewhat stressed. The remaining five criteria, including Equity, efficiency and responsiveness, were ignored. Overall, the political dimension was the most popular focus given that the introduction of the policy itself had been positively welcomed and this served to bolster confidence in the political regime as a whole. Some of the five stages of the process dimension, e.g. agenda setting and formulation, were poorly executed or were skipped, and implementation was fraught with challenges, such as inadequate funding and limited space. Implications in relation to the Multiple Streams Model, policy success/failure theory and the political settlement framework are discussed.","Mohammed, Abdulai Kuyini Kuyini, Ahmed Bawa",,"Mohammed, AK Kuyini, AB",143,"[Mohammed, Abdulai Kuyini] Univ Ghana, Dept Polit Sci, Accra, Ghana.

"This study used comparative case study methodology to investigate student perceptions of different programmes that prepare them for a challenging high school education programme: the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). Given the benefits and challenges of the programme, educators and stakeholders want to ensure students feel ready to participate. In the literature, studies support that programmes such as the International General Certificate of Secondary Education and the International Baccalaureate Organisation's Middle Years Programme prepare students for the IBDP; however, there is a need for students' voices on how they perceive they are prepared through these programmes. This study investigated three different approaches to IBDP preparation by gaining student insights through a scaled-item questionnaire and interviews. Students identified experiences that gave them skills to monitor their learning and resources that motivated them to participate in an advanced upper-high school programme.","Dulun, Oyku Lane, Jennie F.

"Over the past three decades, the study of complex systems has firmly established itself in the research and curricula of many universities around the world. This applies to both the natural and social sciences, and notably across disciplines. Complexity has a profound impact on the epistemology of science, and its place in education deserves reflection. The aim of our research was to explore how complexity might be introduced at a high school level and which knock-on effects such an introduction would have. Our initial findings suggest that complexity science can be made accessible for high-school students and that the resultant awareness can increase students' ability to engage in multi-disciplinary learning. An understanding of complexity arguably plays a crucial part in preparing students for their university education and for their role as stakeholders in deeply interconnected 21st century challenges.

"As the early generation of left-behind children (LBC) in China transition into adulthood and integrate into society, there is a pressing need to understand their experiences beyond the limited scope of existing research. While existing studies have predominantly focused on the short-term and long-term effects of left-behind experiences on children, there exists a notable research gap concerning grown-up LBC. This study addresses this gap by employing the corpus-assisted discourse studies (CADS) to examine the discourse of grown-up LBC on social media. By utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, collocation and concordance analysis, and the ecological systems theory, this study unveils the challenges and opportunities encountered by grown-up LBC, along with their underlying reasons. The findings reveal a myriad of challenges experienced during their left-behind childhood, including material poverty, inadequate parental care, peer bullying, and deficiencies in family and school education. These challenges have been found to contribute to poor psychological well-being, weakened sense of family, distant relationships with parents, and difficulties in forming intimate connections for grown-up LBC. Significantly, the study also uncovers potential positive outcomes, such as the development of self-esteem, independence, and maturity. Moreover, the research highlights the intricate interactions among microsystems, mesosystems, exosystems, and macrosystems, collectively influencing the growth and development of LBC. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex factors influencing the lives of grown-up LBC.","Liang, Linlin Wang, Hongli",,"Liang, LL Wang, HL",,"[Liang, Linlin; Wang, Hongli] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Foreign Studies, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",Xi'an Jiaotong University,,,,,2025-01-19,Corpus-assisted discourse studies; ecological systems theory; LDA topic modeling; left-behind children; social media,10.1177/09579265241263969,Article; Early Access,JUL 2024,1460-3624,hansen@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SK2022156],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Project ID: SK2022156].",ZM8K2,EXPERIENCE; CHINA; OUTCOMES; ANXIETY,,DISCOURSE SOC,niscl.

"This design-based research project explored how various design features of AR-based learning environments (ARLE) influence students' mathematics self-efficacy and learning of kinematics. Specifically, five ARLEs with different design features were developed and implemented with 136 seventh-grade students in two rounds. Data were gathered from pre- and post-mathematics self-efficacy tests, interviews, classroom observation records and reflective journals, to identify which design features promote or hinder students' learning and self-efficacy. Results revealed that adopting a well-designed ARLE is a viable way to promote students' learning and mathematics self-efficacy, and the success of ARLE lies in (1) coherent tasks with proper time for self-exploration, progressive levels, useful problem contexts and a certain degree of open-endedness, and (2) sufficient technological affordances with strengthened authenticity, clarity and integrated media presentation, as well as engaging interactions with decent flexibility, embodied actions and feedback. These results validated the applicability of the proposed checklist for ARLE designers and practitioners in their design and implementation of ARLEs, within the domain of mathematics, physics and beyond. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic AR-based learning environments (ARLEs) have demonstrated substantial advantages in STEM education, but ARLEs can be a drawback if they are not adequately designed. ARLE may facilitate students' mathematics self-efficacy, and relevant design features are underexplored. Design-based research sustains interventions combining empirical research and theory-driven design of innovative learning environments, for example, ARLEs. What this paper adds Demonstrates the potential of ARLEs that can be used in classrooms to support STEM learning. Identifies a collection of effective and ineffective design features of ARLEs that promote or hinder students' STEM learning and mathematics self-efficacy. Tackles the challenges for the design of ARLEs for classrooms by taking AR technological affordances and the pedagogical perspective together. Implications for practice and/or policy Five ARLEs for STEM topics were developed and implemented in secondary schools.

"Background Adoption and use of effective, research-based instructional strategies (RBISs) for STEM education is less widespread than hoped. To promote further use of RBISs, the propagation paradigm suggests that developers work with potential adopters during the development process, and provide ongoing support after adoption. This article investigates the impact of a faculty online learning community (FOLC) as a professional development mechanism for supporting faculty adopting a research-based curriculum. A FOLC uses video conference technology and online platforms to connect geographically dispersed faculty with similar backgrounds (e.g., physics faculty) and supports their teaching development. In the context of a specific FOLC, this article seeks to determine the outcomes the FOLC achieves, and how. Results Analysis of a FOLC meeting identified opportunities for rich, complex social interaction centered on the research-based curriculum. By functioning as a sounding board for ideas, a space to share experiences, a source of affective support, and a venue for troubleshooting, the FOLC mediates the achievement of a range of outcomes related to implementation of the curriculum. Survey results indicate that members feel a sense of community in the FOLC and that it provides encouragement through teaching challenges. Further results indicate participants' increased confidence in using the curriculum; familiarity with the curriculum structure and content; increased knowledge of pedagogical techniques; reflection on teaching practices in the curriculum; and use of pedagogical techniques aligned with the curriculum's core principles. Emerging evidence supports more distal outcomes, including student learning, persistence in using the curriculum, reflection in teaching practice across courses taught, and use of research-based pedagogy in other courses. Conclusions The propagation paradigm emphasizes the need for ongoing support for adopters of RBISs. The FOLC model provides participating faculty with ongoing support through participation in a community and is an effective support mechanism for adopters of a research-based curriculum. In this study, FOLC members are increasing their knowledge and use of pedagogical techniques in the curriculum-specific course and beyond. This is facilitated by the opportunities in the FOLC for troubleshooting, idea sharing, and receiving encouragement through challenges. This model has the potential to support adopters of additional educational innovations.","Price, Edward Lau, Alexandra C. Goldberg, Fred Turpen, Chandra Smith, P.

"Mathematic proficiency has long been associated with the male gender and with high levels of intelligence. Similarly, STEM careers have been linked to the male gender, so both ideas are central to the present article. This study aims to observe differences in attitudes towards mathematic and STEM careers, considering, on the one hand, gender differences and, on the other hand, intelligence, separating the latter variable into a high-ability group and a normative intelligence group. A mixed methods approach was used for the analysis due to its methodological richness, using a reduced version of the Expectations and Values Questionnaire (EVQ) analysed using SPSS v. 25 and two open-ended questions analysed qualitatively using the ALCESTE software. v.1. The results show differences as a function of intelligence, but no gender differences were observed. It is concluded that the results challenge historical conceptions of attitudes towards mathematic and STEM careers.","Rodriguez-Naveiras, Elena Chinea, Sergio Aguirre, Triana Manduca, Nathalia Gonzalez Perez, Teresa Borges, Africa",41,"Rodríguez-Naveiras, E Chinea, S Aguirre, T Manduca, N Pérez, TG Borges, A",,"[Rodriguez-Naveiras, Elena; Chinea, Sergio; Borges, Africa] Univ La Laguna, Fac Psychol & Speech Therapy, Dept Clin Psychol Psychobiol & Methodol, San Cristobal De La Lagun 38200, Spain.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced challenges to delivering laboratory-based STEM curricula. This study evaluates students' learning experience in a synchronous team design activity within the laboratory component of an undergraduate Computer Engineering course during the pandemic. Using the EduPad digital platform, students collaborated in small groups to develop a working design for a software simulator. The researchers measured students' social, cognitive, and teaching presences during the remote team design activities and gathered their feedback on the learning experience. The findings demonstrate that students exhibited high levels of cognitive presence during the remote team design activities, suggesting effective strategies for promoting cognitive presence in synchronous engineering laboratory instruction. This study contributes to the community of inquiry framework and expands the existing repertoire of techniques for enhancing cognitive presence in online synchronous instruction. The implications for further research are also discussed.","Chen, Baiyun DeMara, Ronald F.",,"Chen, BY DeMara, RF",162,"[Chen, Baiyun] Univ Cent Florida, Ctr Distributed Learning, Orlando, FL 32826 USA.

"Culturally responsive pedagogy has received increasing research attention and has been applied in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in higher education to support an increasingly diverse student body in recent years. This study aimed to uncover the pedagogical machinations that govern how STEM faculty members teach, interact and engage with their culturally and ethnically diverse students in the United States of America. Eight STEM faculty members participated in one of three focus group sessions in this study. Data from the focus groups were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings show that instructors were aware of the importance of addressing issues of diversity in instruction and adapted their instruction to accommodate students' diverse backgrounds and experiences. Additionally, the study identified challenges faced by STEM faculty members in adopting culturally responsive pedagogy. These, along with the study's limitations, inform future research directions and application of culturally responsive pedagogy.","Xie, Jingrong Ferguson, Yuna",,"Xie, JR Ferguson, Y",1215,"[Xie, Jingrong] Univ Missouri Syst, Missouri Online, St Louis, MO USA.

"The purpose of this study is to investigate teachers' practices and views of STEM activities for children aged 4-7 years old. The participants are 18 Greek teachers and data is collected via interviews. Commonly reported reasons for the importance of STEM education are the development of skills, knowledge, and children's interest for learning, while the skills children develop, include collaboration, communication, socialisation, problem-solving, experimentation, critical thinking, programming, creativity, and language/literacy. STEM activities implemented in class are programming, robotics and interdisciplinary activities, as well as experiments and exploration of materials. The primary factors considered when preparing STEM activities are children's interest-motivation, their cognitive level or age, and the learning outcomes. Teachers' perceived challenges mainly regard experiential learning, children's interest and active participation, while main problems include limited time, infrastructure, and teacher training. Implications for educational policy-practice and teacher training are discussed.","Nikolopoulou, Kleopatra",,"Nikolopoulou, K",806,"[Nikolopoulou, Kleopatra] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Sch Educ, Dept Early Childhood Educ, Navarinou 13A, Athens 10680, Greece.",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM; early childhood; preschool; teacher practices; teacher views,10.1080/09669760.2022.2128994,Article,SEP 2022,1469-8463,klnikolop@ecd.uoa.gr,821,,,,O3OM3,,3,INT J EARLY YEARS ED,Int.

"Community colleges have long been touted as a pathway to increase social mobility through their transfer function, yet this promise has not always been realized. This study uses the lens of community cultural wealth, particularly the concepts of aspirational, social, and navigational capitals, to understand vertical transfer students' experiences and outcomes during the pandemic. Longitudinal interviews were conducted with 27 students over a four-year period as they moved through the transfer pathway in STEM majors. Students who transferred to a university immediately prior to or during the pandemic experienced greater academic and navigational challenges and reported diminished access to social capital. Students employed multiple, informal navigational strategies and drew on social networks, when possible, to maintain their academic progress. Findings also reveal the importance of the transfer-receiving department, especially access to supportive institutional agents, in sustaining STEM transfer students' progress during COVID-19.","Thiry, Heather Harper, Raquel Zahner, Dana Holland",,"Thiry, H Harper, R Zahner, DH",,"[Thiry, Heather; Harper, Raquel; Zahner, Dana Holland] Univ Colorado, Ethnog & Evaluat Res, Boulder, CO USA.

"The National Science Foundation and other funding agencies are increasingly requiring broader impacts in grant applications to encourage US scientists to contribute to science education and society. Concurrently, national science education standards are using more inquiry-based learning (IBL) to increase students' capacity for abstract, conceptual thinking applicable to real-world problems. Scientists are particularly well suited to engage in broader impacts via science inquiry outreach, because scientific research is inherently an inquiry-based process. We provide a practical guide to help scientists overcome obstacles that inhibit their engagement in K-12 IBL outreach and to attain the accrued benefits. Strategies to overcome these challenges include scaling outreach projects to the time available, building collaborations in which scientists' research overlaps with curriculum, employing backward planning to target specific learning objectives, encouraging scientists to share their passion, as well as their expertise with students, and transforming institutional incentives to support scientists engaging in educational outreach.","Komoroske, Lisa M.

"There is an increasing worldwide trend toward the development of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education using engineering design (ED) practice. Considering that teachers play pivotal roles in terms of student interest in STEM subjects and careers, it is important to explore teachers' perceptions of STEM-ED education. We analysed survey data from 184 technology teachers who participated in empowerment training (using a STEM-ED curriculum) in 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022. We used an importance-performance analytical model to investigate the teachers' perceptions of STEM-ED itself, its impact on students, and the challenges experienced during implementation. The results showed that various improvements were required for STEM-ED promotion and for the preparation of STEM-ED lessons. Analysis of variance revealed that the age groups taught and the number of weekly teaching hours significantly affected the teachers' perceptions of STEM-ED. These findings will assist educational institutions worldwide in planning future education policies, designing teacher empowerment courses, and understanding teachers' needs in efforts to improve STEM-ED.","Chien, Yu-Hung Chang, Fang-Yu",157,"Chien, YH Chang, FY",,"[Chien, Yu-Hung] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.

"In the rush to implement STEM programmes in economically disadvantaged school districts, there is a pressing need to develop a stronger sense of what might be considered effective and appropriate STEM practices for diverse students. The aim of this study was to characterise the experience of implementing an integrated STEM Project-Based Learning (PBL) programme in an Australian secondary school located within a diverse, socio-economically disadvantaged community. To identify enablers and constraints in delivering STEM PBL in this context, the study utilised qualitative data from interviews with school teachers and leaders, school planning documents and an extended series of classroom observations. Key findings point towards the importance of building a school culture that supports innovative pedagogy; the need to purposefully scaffold the capabilities of teachers and students to engage with active learning; and the potential value of multi-dimensional assessment allowing students to demonstrate STEM proficiency through novel forms of evidence.","Wilson, Kimberley",,"Wilson, K",881,"[Wilson, Kimberley] Australian Catholic Univ Brisbane, Fac Educ & Arts, Sch Educ, 1100 Nudgee Rd, Banyo, Qld 4014, Australia.",Australian Catholic University; Australian Catholic University - Brisbane Campus,,,,,2025-01-19,Interdisciplinary instruction; Project-based learning; Secondary education; STEM education,10.1007/s10763-020-10103-8,Article,JUN 2020,1573-1774,Kimberley.wilson@acu.edu.au,897,,,,TS5XA,,5,INT J SCI MATH EDUC,Int.

"Programming activities have the potential to provide a rich context for exploring measurement units in early elementary mathematics. This study examines how a small group of young children (ages 5-6) express their emergent conception of a dynamic linear unit and the measurement concepts they found challenging. Video of an introductory programming lesson was analyzed for evidence of preconceptions and conceptions of a dynamic linear unit. Using Artifact-Centric Activity Theory as a lens for the analysis, we found that social context, gesturing, and verbal descriptions influenced the children's understanding of a dynamic linear unit. Challenges that students encountered included developing a constructed conception of a unit, reconciling preconceptions about the meaning of a code, and socially-influenced preconceptions. This study furthers the exploration of computational thinking and mathematics connections and provides a basis for future exploration of dynamic mathematics and programming learning in early elementary education.","Welch, Lise E.

"Science fiction conventions are places where the convergence of science fiction and science is discussed within diverse communities. Many of these science fiction conventions offer programming focused on science, often described as science tracks, for science experts to share their experiences, expertise, scientific findings, and applications related to current research in connection to science fiction with the public. Framing the study within a socio-cultural context, this study surveyed experts' (n = 19) perceived beliefs of science communication at science fiction conventions. Experts cited accessibility and promoting scientific curiosity as the greatest benefits and identified misconceptions or misinterpretation by the audience as challenges. Overall, experts agreed that communicating science is important and science fiction has a great impact on science. Because of the public access to experts, it is important to highlight the potential influence science fiction conventions may have on science communication via socio-cultural experiences and contexts within popular culture.","Childers, Gina Governor, Donna Greer, Kania James, Vaughan",,"Childers, G Governor, D Greer, K James, V",149,"[Childers, Gina] Texas Tech Univ, Coll Educ, STEM Educ, 3002 18th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.

"Practical teaching can give authentic learning experiences and teach valuable skills for undergraduate students in the STEM disciplines. One of the main ways of giving students such experiences, laboratory teaching, is met with many challenges such as budget cuts, increased use of virtual learning, and currently the university lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight how at-home do-it-yourself (DIY) experiments can be a good way to include physical interaction with your study organism, system, or technique to give the students a practical, authentic learning experience. We hope that by outlining the benefits of a practical, at-home, DIY experiment we can inspire more people to design these teaching activities in the current remote teaching situation and beyond. By contributing two examples in the field of plant biology we enrich the database on experiments to draw inspiration from for these teaching methods.","Gya, Ragnhild Bjune, Anne Elisabeth",,"Gya, R Bjune, AE",3481,"[Gya, Ragnhild; Bjune, Anne Elisabeth] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway.",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,,,,,2025-01-19,at&#8208; home experiment; botany experiment; inquiry&#8208; based learning; remote learning; student active,10.1002/ece3.7207,Article,FEB 2021,,ragnhild.gya@uib.no,3487,,,,RP1CZ,SCIENCE; LABORATORIES; EXPERIENCES; REMOTE,8,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

"In the early 1990s, cyberfeminism emerged as an area of knowledge to discuss the connection between gender and technology. According to UNESCO, women are underrepresented in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and less than a third of women worldwide work in scientific research and development. However, this number has grown and this reality is constantly changing. In this context, using business intelligence techniques, this study analyzes data from the computer and information and communication technology market to characterize the impact of the performance of women in these areas. It is expected to show that this performance in the highlighted fields is still a challenge in Brazil. Based on this hypothesis, results indicates that public policies must be focused on the base, i.e., to encourage young women to work in STEM areas. This study could encourage policymakers to find solutions to the challenges presented in this research.","Gallindo, Erica L. Cruz, Hobson A. Moreira, Mario W.

"Rapid modernization in Saudi Arabia has led to environmental challenges like pollution. Public understanding of pollutants is crucial for public participation in Saudi government efforts to monitor and mitigate impacts. This cross-sectional observational study aimed to assess the awareness and perceptions of environmental pollutants among 817 adults in Saudi Arabia's Jazan region. The online survey identified transportation and industrial emissions as widely recognized hazards, but there were gaps regarding risks like asbestos. Illegal dumping and junk houses were major concerns. Females had 1.86 times higher adjusted odds of concern about outdoor environmental risks compared to males (AOR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.12-2.84; p = 0.004). Participants with high school education or above had significantly increased odds of concern about outdoor hazards, with 4.27 times higher odds for those with high school education (AOR: 4.27; 95% CI: 1.92-9.52; p < 0.001) and 3.51 times higher odds for those with university education or above (AOR: 3.51; 95% CI: 1.59-7.72; p = 0.002). Self-reported environmental interest was strongly associated with concern about outdoor and indoor air pollution, with 4.89 times higher adjusted odds of concern about outdoor air pollution (AOR: 4.89, 95% CI: 3.02-7.93, p < 0.001) and 2.86 times higher adjusted odds of concern about indoor air quality (AOR: 2.86, 95% CI: 2.86-4.47, p < 0.001). Overall, Jazan residents display general but incomplete awareness of health hazards, signaling a need for expanded educational efforts to improve consciousness of less visible pollutants. Effective public communication strategies built on these insights can strengthen societal environmental awareness in Saudi Arabia and promote sustainability.","Alqassim, Ahmad Y. Alharbi, Abdullah A.

"The convergence of numerous trends indicates that a physician shortage by 2020 is likely. There is a 25% growth in the overall population, but that of the college-age sector is increasing by only 5%. The numbers of African Americans and Latinos in that sector will increase more than wilt members of other population groups; these two groups are most affected by the uneven quality of science education in urban high schools. Challenges to create a pipeline of a large, diverse, and qualified pool of medical school applicants are great, and are influenced by the actual and perceived cost of medical school tuition and the competition from other professions. Since 1973, the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, a seven-year joint BS/MD program, has expanded access to medical school education for talented inner-city youths, including minorities and those with limited financial resources. Students receive a BS degree and their first two years of medical school education and, upon success-ful completion of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1, transfer to one of five cooperating medical schools in New York State that confer the terminal MD degree. Sophie Davis integrates medical studies in the baccalaureate program, using actual performance in medical studies as a predictor of success. Of the more than 1,400 of its graduates, 25% are African American, 8% are Latino, 28% are Asian American, and 39% are white. Over 25% of its current student body comes from federally defined low-income families, and almost three-quarters qualify for New York State financial aid. The Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education is a model that offers a partial response to those factors that will challenge the achievement of an adequate supply of physicians for our urban communities. The author describes the model in detail and explains how it helps talented but unevenly educated students rise to the challenge of a medical education.","Roman, SA",,"Roman, SA",1175,"CUNY City Coll, Sophie Davis Sch Biomed Educ, New York, NY 10031 USA.",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1097/00001888-200412000-00010,Article,,1938-808X,stanrom@sci.ccny.cuny.edu,1183,,,,874IR,MCAT SCORES; HEALTH-CARE; STUDENTS; PERFORMANCES; SCHOOL; PREDICTION; EDUCATION; QUALITY; PROGRAM; TRENDS,12,ACAD MED,Acad.

"Background: Many individuals undergo drug addiction treatment relapse after treatment. Additionally, a few studies have focused on the unique challenges faced by women in addiction recovery. Therefore, we aimed to identify predictors of relapse among women who have undergone drug addiction treatment to develop a more effective intervention program tailored to their needs. Methods: The present cross-sectional study evaluated 320 addicted women from Lorestan province, Iran, in 2020 who had used illegal substances. Convenience sampling was used to select participants from outpatient addiction treatment centers, triangular clinics, and rehabilitation centers. Demographic characteristics, drug use patterns, and risk factors for addiction were recorded. Predictors of relapse were evaluated using a negative binomial regression model. Results: The study included women with a mean age of 34.78 +/- 9.31 years who had a history of drug addiction relapse. Around 43.44% of the women were married and 36.88% lived with their husbands. Methamphetamine, opium, and heroin were the commonly used drugs. The study found that women with primary school education had a higher rate of relapse (IRR: 1.71, p = 0.01) and women with husbands being substance users (IRR: 1.34, p = 0.014), history of imprisonment (IRR: 1.51, p = 0.002), smoking (IRR: 1.91, p < 0.001), and alcohol consumption (IRR: 1.49, p = 0.005) were also associated with a higher rate of relapse. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study found that women with primary school education, husbands being substance users, history of imprisonment, smoking, and alcohol consumption behavior had a higher rate of relapse. By addressing the identified predictors of relapse, such programs can improve the success rate of addiction treatment and promote long-term recovery among women. In addition, this study highlights that addiction relapse is not necessarily caused by a single factor, and several different personal and environmental factors can influence this issue.","Ghasemi, Faezeh Bashirian, Saeid Fakher, Fatemeh Mohammadi Barati, Majid Khazaei, Salman",,"Ghasemi, F Bashirian, S Fakher, FM Barati, M Khazaei, S",64,"[Ghasemi, Faezeh; Khazaei, Salman] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Hamadan, Iran.

"Indigenous schools are spaces for the convergence of different worldviews and to demonstrate how the creativity of each ethnic group challenges exogenous and established concepts and methodologies. The present article examines main trends and pending gaps related to indigenous education in Brazil between the years 2007 and 2019. Issues such as the characterisation of indigenous schools, teachers and students are analysed, with a focus on the evolution of the number of students enrolled, infrastructure, language and pedagogic approaches. The analysis is focused on the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, which has a large indigenous population and an economy based on export-oriented agribusiness, and Sao Paulo, the main economic, demographic and political centre of Brazil with a much smaller indigenous population. The results demonstrate concrete improvements, especially the expansion of the number of schools and the student population. A growing number of schools are now dedicated to serve indigenous populations and make use of specific teaching material (although this material is of uneven quality). However, many problems remain unresolved, as in the case of threats to funding and uncertain administrative support from public authorities, a situation that has been aggravated in recent years with the growing adoption of elitist, anti-indigenous government policies.","Ioris, Antonio Augusto Rossotto Longo, Flavia Do Carmo, Roberto Arruti, Jose Mauricio",,"Ioris, AAR Longo, F Do Carmo, R Arruti, JM",,"[Ioris, Antonio Augusto Rossotto] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg, King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff, Wales.

"Objectives: This study explored US rural parents' perceived facilitators, challenges and motivators to healthy eating. Methods: Qualitative and purposive sampling was used to recruit one hundred (N = 100) parents of children enrolled in the fourth grade to participate in a series of focus group sessions. Eligibility criteria included being the head of the household and having a child enrolled in the fourth grade. Parents were questioned about factors impacting everyday lifestyle practices such as nutrition knowledge and eating habits. Data were analysed using grounded theory and constant comparative method. Results: Twelve focus groups sessions were conducted with parents who self-identified as African American (63%), Hispanic (25%) and Caucasian 2%. The majority (52%) of participants indicated they only had some high school education. Healthy eating among parents was highly dependent on socioeconomic status, time, availability and access to foods. Facilitators to healthy eating were school lunch programmes, nutrition education and family preferences. Findings demonstrate that parents tried to eat meals at home, but many factors (fear of genetically modified foods, money and time) prevented healthy eating and food preparation. Parents who consumed or prepared meals at home did so because of family influence and the fear of being unhealthy. Conclusion and implications: This study provides an in-depth understanding of rural parents' efforts to promote healthy eating at home regardless of socioeconomic challenges.","McDonald, Andrea E.

"This paper deals with the challenges of developing communicative competence representing a fundamental competence in the framework of future teacher professional training. The authors believe, that the above competence is underpinned by the speech mastery of a teacher and effective communication practice. The authors identified contradictions in the existing system of communicative training and outlined the way forward for developing communicative competence of students in pedagogical universities in the context of implementation of the new Federal State Standard of Higher Education. Communicative competence is viewed as a universal transprofessional meta-competence, which should be developed, first of all, through subject areas with philological focus, offering special assignments aimed at developing practical communicative skills: language, speech and rhetorical skills necessary for further professional activity of a teacher. The research carried out by the authors, supported by theoretical analysis, synthesis, classification and generalization, and method of pedagogical design, made it possible to refine and adjust the variable part of curricula, to make substantial changes in the design of programs and classes for students seeking Bachelor's degree in the field of training Pedagogical Education, specialties Primary Education; and Pre-school Education.

"To meet challenges related to changing demographics, and to optimize the promise of diversity, radiologists must bridge the gap between numbers of women and historically underrepresented minorities in radiology and radiation oncology as contrasted with other medical specialties. Research reveals multiple ways that women and underrepresented minorities can benefit radiology education, research, and practice. To achieve those benefits, promising practices promote developing and implementing strategies that support diversity as an institutional priority and cultivate shared responsibility among all members to create inclusive learning and workplace environments. Strategies also include providing professional development to empower and equip members to accomplish diversity-related goals. Among topics for professional development about diversity, unconscious bias has shown positive results. Unconscious bias refers to ways humans unknowingly draw upon assumptions about individuals and groups to make decisions about them. Researchers have documented unconscious bias in a variety of contexts and professions, including health care, in which they have studied differential treatment, diagnosis, prescribed care, patient well-being and compliance, physician-patient interactions, clinical decision making, and medical school education. These studies demonstrate unfavorable impacts on members of underrepresented groups and women. Learning about and striving to counteract unconscious bias points to promising practices for increasing the numbers of women and underrepresented minorities in the radiology and radiation oncology workforce.","Allen, Brenda J.

"The current research aims to summarize the features of school education in rural areas in Ukraine and to establish their potential influence on students' academic and socio-psychological adaptation to a new learning and living environment. Small number of students in class, poor material and technical condition, limited opportunities for self-realization, low motivation to study etc. are distinguished as the basic peculiarities of Ukrainian rural schools. The authors' mini-questionnaire revealed that 62% of the first-year students of rural origin from a local Bohdan Khmelnytsky National University at Cherkasy experience hardships during adaptation. Challenges faced by 270 first-year students are described: personal, educational, living conditions, psychological, communicative, relationships in the group. The outcomes of the study convince that students of rural origin encounter additional challenges adjusting to changed living conditions while studying in universities in contrast to students from urban and suburban areas. Recommendations are provided to assist rural school counselors in preparing students for their further adaptation at large colleges and universities. Directions of work of psychological service, counsellors and educators in higher education institutions are displayed: individual counseling for the student, development and implementation of special training programs, integration of individual classes into training programs.","Shalivska, Yulia Tkachenko, Kateryna Danylyuk, Serhiy",e9537,"Shalivska, Y Tkachenko, K Danylyuk, S",,"[Shalivska, Yulia] Rivne State Univ Humanities, Dept Theory & Methods Educ, Stepana Bandery Str 12, Rivne, Ukraine.

"United Nations of Education Scientific and Cultural Organisation's (UNESCO's) founding statements about environmental education (EE) in the 1970s positioned it as a multidisciplinary field of inquiry. When enacted as such, it challenges traditional ways of organising secondary school education by academic subject areas. Equally, according to UNESCO, EE requires various forms of integrated and project-based teaching and learning approaches. These can involve hands-on experimentation alongside the retrieval and critical analysis of information from diverse sources and perspectives, and with different qualities and statuses. Multidisciplinary and knowledge engagement challenges are key considerations for an EE curriculum designed to harness information and communication technologies (ICT) to support and enhance student learning, which also challenge traditional instructional priorities that for example are largely based on textbooks. This review summarises research that has sought to integrate ICT and digital tools in EE. A key finding is that while there is a rich variety of such tools and applications available, there is far less research on their fit with and implications for student learning. The review calls for further studies that will provide models of productive forms of teaching and learning that harness ICT resources, particularly in developing the goals and methodologies of EE in the twenty-first century.","Fauville, G.

"Open innovation crowdsourcing can help enterprises meet the challenges of a rapidly changing environment and improve their innovation performance. This study introduces network externalities as influencing factors of the crowdsourcing open innovation synergy mechanism. This study constructed the game payment matrix of the crowdsourcing open innovation synergy mechanism, and the evolutionary game method obtained the equilibrium solution of the crowdsourcing open innovation synergy mechanism. The impact of changes in the main influencing factors on the issuers' and receivers' willingness to collaborate and innovate was explored through numerical and case studies. The study shows that the higher the synergy benefit and its allocation coefficient need to be within a reasonable range for the willingness to collaborate and innovate to increase; the lower the original cost of both parties, and the higher the cost reduction coefficient under the policy support of the crowdsourcing platform, the higher the willingness to collaborate and innovate; the higher the network externality and the lower the penalty for breach of contract, the higher the desire to collaborate and innovate. The study recommends strengthening non-school education to guide innovation for all, and refining relevant policies to tailor innovation to local conditions. This study provides a new perspective and theoretical guidance for enterprises to build a crowdsourcing open innovation synergy mechanism and is a valuable reference for open innovation management.","Jiang, Yanyan Zhang, Lichi Wu, Junmin",e17512,"Jiang, YY Zhang, LC Wu, JM",,"[Jiang, Yanyan; Zhang, Lichi; Wu, Junmin] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Zhenjiang 212000, Peoples R China.

"Community colleges are frequently an affordable, accessible entrance to a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and career, but the transition from a 2-year program to a 4-year institution can be tumultuous. In this mixed-methods study, we explore the experiences of transfer and prospective transfer students. Through surveys and interviews, we identify the challenges faced by and the supports desired by biology transfer students. We describe how community college students perceive their introductory biology courses, and we compare the biology identity and self-efficacy of these students to peers at a 4-year institution. Students expressed uncertainty about what to expect from the transfer experience, and they benefitted from interventions that made the university experience more concrete or clarified their expectations. We found that community college students are just as interested in biology as peers at a 4-year university, but they are significantly less likely to believe that others recognize them as ""biology people"" and report less self-efficacy regarding biology courses. Students felt particularly well-prepared for transfer after community college biology courses they described as ""rigorous"" and ""demanding,"" especially because students expressed that the community college environment helped support them through the challenges of higher education.","Teshera-Levye, Jennifer Atchison, Tammy Callis-Duehl, Kristine Gould, Thomas Lichti, Deborah Scemama, Jean-Luc Stiller, John Vance-Chalcraft, Heather D.",e0011623,"Teshera-Levye, J Atchison, T Callis-Duehl, K Gould, T Lichti, D Scemama, JL Stiller, J Vance-Chalcraft, HD",,"[Teshera-Levye, Jennifer; Scemama, Jean-Luc; Stiller, John; Vance-Chalcraft, Heather D.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.

"The Youth Strike for Climate raised important global attention to interconnected climate, energy and environmental issues - it also compelled us to consider what we will do to address these pressing challenges. Developed through consideration of such dynamics, we propose critical energy literacy as an emerging theory that denotes understanding of the social, environmental, political and economic challenges, benefits and impacts of various energy sources, developments and technologies. Critical energy literacy is grounded in critical and decolonising approaches to STEM education; considerations for collaborative multi-, inter- and Trans disciplinary pedagogy; critical place-based inquiry and pedagogy; critical gender perspectives and critical media literacy and engagement. Enhancing societal critical energy literacy will assist with more equitable energy, transit, construction and environmental planning by and for communities, businesses and governments. In this theory-building commentary, we share insights related to and principles for our emerging theory of critical energy literacy which coalesced through personal experience with and previous studies into related initiatives and areas of inquiry, and recent reviews of literature as well as K-12, post-secondary and not-for-profit curricula in Canada with consideration for international contexts. A discussion of renewable energy development and education focused on the Canadian province of Alberta is presented as an illuminating exemplar.","Lowan-Trudeau, Gregory Fowler, Teresa Anne",,"Lowan-Trudeau, G Fowler, TA",58,"[Lowan-Trudeau, Gregory] Univ Calgary, Werklund Sch Educ, Calgary, AB, Canada.

"Previous research suggests that in classes that take an integrated approach to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, students tend to engage in fulfilling goals of their engineering design challenges, but only inconsistently engage with the related math and science content. The present research examines these inconsistences by focusing on student engagement, or effort, towards math and science concepts while working on an engineering challenge, through the lens of expectancy-value theory. Specifically, we examine how students' perceptions of the value of math and science and expectancy for success with the math and science relate to the efforts they put towards using math and science while working on engineering challenges. Our results suggest that subjective task value significantly predicts efforts towards both math and science, whereas neither expectancy, nor the interaction between expectancy and value predicted effort. We argue that integrated learning environments need to help students understand how the domains of math, science, and engineering support their work in fulfilling the engineering project design goals. In other words, weargue that we, as educators, must help students to recognise the value of each of the domains addressed within STEM integrated learning environments. This paper discusses strategies for accomplishing this goal.","Berland, Leema K.

"Robots are a popular and engaging educational tool for teaching computational thinking, but they often have significant costs and limitations for classroom use. Switching to a simulated environment can eliminate many of these difficulties. By also providing students with a block-based programming environment, the barrier to entry can be further reduced. This paper presents a networked virtual robotics platform designed to create an environment which is highly accessible for novice students and their teachers alike, along with components of a curriculum designed to teach computational thinking skills through robotics programming challenges, including autonomous challenges and in-class competitions. Students access this platform through an extension of the same web interface used for programming their robots, which allows students to collaborate on code and view a shared simulated virtual space. Previously, this virtual robotics platform was used only to facilitate distance education. This paper demonstrates its use in an in-person class during the Spring 2022 semester, illustrating the affordances of a virtual robotics environment for face-to-face learning contexts as well. Students' computational thinking skills were evaluated with assessments both before and after the class, along with surveys and interviews given to determine their opinions and outlooks regarding computer science. The results show that students had a significant improvement in both attitudes and aptitudes.","Stein, Gordon Jean, Devin Brady, Corey Ledeczi, Akos",1031572,"Stein, G Jean, D Brady, C Lédeczi, A",,"[Stein, Gordon; Jean, Devin; Ledeczi, Akos] Vanderbilt Univ, Inst Software Integrated Syst, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.

"The integration of artificial intelligence into education has emerged as a promising avenue for enriching teaching and learning experiences. Nevertheless, the successful implementation of artificial intelligence in educational contexts hinges upon various factors, one of which is the perspective of instructors. With this in mind, this study aimed to examine the perspectives of 536 instructors in STEM and non-STEM disciplines regarding AI integration. The respondents' thoughts, opinions, and concerns regarding advantages, disadvantages and challenges were gathered through an online questionnaire featuring both closed and open-ended questions. Additionally, a series of semi-structured interview sessions were conducted with a cohort of instructors to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The findings revealed that both STEM and non-STEM instructors expressed positive attitudes toward the integration of AI technologies into education. However, notable differences in responses and concerns were also identified in relation to the perceived capabilities and limitations of AI technologies within educational contexts. The results further elucidated a spectrum of opinions on the benefits (e.g., scalability and tirelessness), drawbacks (e.g., deepfake technology and comfort-seeking behavior), and potential challenges (e.g., educational disillusionment and espionage) associated with AI integration. The study concluded by discussing the implications of these findings for STEM and non-STEM education and offering recommendations for the effective and ethical integration of AI technologies in classrooms.","Parviz, Muhammed",100190,"Parviz, M",,"[Parviz, Muhammed] Imam Ali Univ, Tehran, Iran.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Artificial Intelligence; Education; STEM; Perspective; Non-STEM,10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100190,Article,MAY 2024,,mohammad.parviz60@gmail.com,,,,,UK0R6,,,COMPUT EDUC OPEN,Computer Educ.

"Services of General Interest (SGI) are basic services that society and economy vitally need to function and develop. Securing access to these services is a key concern in many European spatial planning systems. In remote regions across Europe, SGI provision is facing challenges due to demographic and economic transformation processes. Opposing political proposals on how to address these challenges are often rooted in opposing ethical convictions. This article sheds light on the perspectives that different ethical concepts offer on SGI provision and explores the practical repercussions they entail. It is shown that proponents of libertarianism will advocate for allowing people to move to or stay in remote regions without adequate access to SGI as long as this is their voluntary and conscious decision, whereas proponents of egalitarianism will consider it a matter of justice to ensure universal access to SGI in remote regions even if this presupposes major societal efforts. Proponents of utilitarianism, it is shown, will consider it reasonable to expand SGI in densely populated regions, where provision is cost-effective and many people benefit from it, and to reduce it in remote regions, where costs of provision are high and users are few. These positions are illustrated using the examples of school education and local public transport. The article puts forward the view that while a reflection of the different ethical positions cannot resolve the challenges that SGI provision in remote regions is facing, it is often possible to find solutions for SGI provision that reconcile the seemingly contradictory demands resulting from the different positions. The reflection of the different positions thus contributes to reasoned, informed decision-making on SGI provision in spatial planning and beyond.","Stielike, Jan Matthias",,"Stielike, JM",53,"[Stielike, Jan Matthias] Jade Univ Appl Sci, Urban & Rural Planning, Oldenburg, Germany.

"Background Race and gender disparities remain a challenge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. We introduce campus racial climate as a framework for conceptualizing the role of racial microaggressions (RMAs) as a contributing factor to the lack of representation of domestic students of color in STEM programs on college campuses. We analyze the experiences of students of color in STEM majors who have faced RMAs at the campus, academic, and peer levels. We draw from an online survey of more than 4800 students of color attending a large public university in the USA. The STEM major subsample is made up of 1688 students of color. The study estimates a series of Poisson regressions to examine whether one's race, gender, or class year can be used to predict the likelihood of the regular occurrence of microaggressions. We also use interview data to further understand the challenges faced by STEM students of color. Results The quantitative and qualitative data suggest that RMAs are not isolated incidents but are ingrained in the campus culture, including interactions with STEM instructors and advisers and with peers. Students of color experience RMAs at all three levels, but Black students in the STEM majors are more likely to experience RMAs than other students of color in the sample. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the need for campus officials, academic professionals, faculty members, and students to work together to address racism at the campus, academic, and peer levels. Additionally, STEM departments must address the impacts of the larger racial campus culture on their classrooms, as well as how departmental culture reinforces racial hostility in academic settings. Finally, our findings reveal the continued presence of anti-Black racism in higher education.","Lee, Meggan J. Collins, Jasmine D.

"Background: Dataset skills are used in STEM fields from astronomy to zoology. Few fields explicitly teach students the skills to analyze datasets, and yet the increasing push for authentic science implies these skills should be taught. Purpose: The overarching motivation of this work is to understand authentic science learning of STEM dataset skills within an astronomy context. Specifically, when participants work with a 200-entry Google Sheets dataset of astronomical data, what are they learning, how are they learning it, and who is doing the learning? Sample: The authors studied a total of 82 post-secondary participants, including a matched set of 54 pre/post-test (34 males, 18 females), 26 video recorded (22 males, 2 females), and 3 interviewed (2 males, 1 female) participants. Design and methods: In this mixed & xfeff;-methods study, participants explored a three-phase dataset activity and were given an eight-question multiple-choice pre/post-test covering skills of analyzing datasets and astronomy content, with the cognitive load of questions spanning from recognition of terms through synthesizing multiple ideas. Pre/post-test scores were compared and ANOVA performed for subsamples by gender. Select examples of qualitative data are shown, including written answers to questions, video recordings, and interviews. Results: This project expands existing literature on authentic science experiences into the domain of dataset education in astronomy. Participants exhibited learning in both recall and synthesis questions. Females exhibited lower levels of learning than males which could be connected to gender influence. Conversations of both males and females included gendered topics. Conclusions: Implications of the study include a stronger dataset focus in post-secondary STEM education, and the need for further investigation into how instructors can ameliorate the challenges faced by female post-secondary students.","Schwortz, Andria C.

"Introduction Twenty percent of breast cancer survivors have co-occurring diabetes and face a 50% greater risk of 10-year mortality compared to survivors without diabetes. Individuals with cancer are often overwhelmed during cancer treatment and have less time for their diabetes, contributing to worse outcomes. We elicited perspectives of breast cancer survivors with diabetes regarding their specific needs for diabetes and cancer co-management. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with women with breast cancer aged 40 + years at three New York City hospitals from May 2021 to March 2022. Eligible participants had type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes. Interviews were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and coded by two independent reviewers. Results We conducted interviews with 15 females with breast cancer of mean age 61.5 years (SD 7.2); 70% were Black, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander, and 20% had only a high school education. Most (73%) patients were insured by Medicaid or Medicare, and 73% underwent chemotherapy as part of their cancer care. Of the 15 participants, 60% reported that their glucose levels were of control during cancer treatment and nearly 50% reported glucose levels > 200 mg/dL. We identified distinct themes that reflect patient-reported challenges (worse glucose control after initiation of cancer treatment, lack of information on co-managing diabetes, negative psychosocial effects, burden of diabetes management during cancer care) and needs/priorities (designated provider to help, educational resources specific to diabetes and cancer, and individualized care plans). Conclusions Patients co-managing diabetes and cancer face challenges and have unmet needs that should be addressed to improve diabetes control during cancer treatment. Our findings can directly inform interventions aimed at improving glucose control in this population.","Pinheiro, Laura C. Cho, Jacklyn Rothman, Julia Zeng, Caroline Wilson, Micayla Kern, Lisa M.

"The article is for analysis of new experience in the national context - organisation of distance education in preschool education and the challenges in application of the innovation, when the implementation as such has not been planned and modelled for getting ready for it in advance. In Lithuania, before the COVID-19 pandemic distance education in the preschool education meant for reparation of a child ready for school was not applied, there were no specific guidelines, tested teaching platforms or pedagogic practices. The study deals with the results of a focus groups research performed in June of 2020, designated for discussing of experiences of the Lithuanian preschool education institutions in distance education gained during the quarantine (16/03/2020 to 29/05/2020). The performed analysis of experiences in organisation of distant education in preschool education disclosed the essential challenges faced when applying this form of education in the education of six-year-old children. It has been established that the key challenges organizing distance education in the preschool education are related to lack of the IT solutions for distant education; readiness of the participants of the education process for distant education and engagement into such process of education, as well as the lack of support from national and regional institutions in organisation of distant education. The results of the research open possibilities for further researches which are necessary for efficient and sustainable distant education integration into preschool education. In this background, explicit, deep research related to analysis of appropriateness of distance education platforms in the stages of early age, search for didactic solutions of digital content for them and deep researches of implementation cases and etc. is necessary.","Merfeldaite, Odeta Prakapas, Romas Railiene, Asta",,"Merfeldaite, O Prakapas, R Railiene, A",141,"[Merfeldaite, Odeta; Prakapas, Romas; Railiene, Asta] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",Mykolas Romeris University,,,,,2025-01-19,Preschool education; organisation of education; distance education; COVID-19,,Article,,,o.merfeldaite@mruni.eu; prakapas@mruni.eu; asta.railiene@mruni.eu,153,,,,YJ6GY,ONLINE; TECHNOLOGY; CHILDREN; PARENTS; TEACH; ICT,40,DIGIT EDUC REV,Digit.

"Professional development on issues of language and culture is often separate from professional development on issues related to STEM education, resulting in linguistic and cultural gaps in K-12 STEM pedagogy and practice. To address this issue, we have designed a model of professional development in which we work with educators to build cultural and linguistic competence and to disseminate information about how educators view the relevance of language, communication, and culture to STEM teaching and learning. We describe the design and facilitation of our model of culturally and linguistically responsive professional development, grounded in theories of multicultural education and culturally supportive teaching, through professional development workshops to 60 K-12 STEM educators from schools in Maryland and Virginia that serve African American students. Participants noted that culturally and linguistically responsive approaches had yet to permeate their K-12 STEM settings, which they identified as a critical challenge to effectively teaching and engaging African-American students. Based on pre-surveys, workshops were tailored to participants' stated needs for information on literacy (e.g., disciplinary literacies and discipline-specific jargon), cultural conflict and mismatch (e.g., student-teacher miscommunication), and linguistic bias in student assessment (e.g., test design). Educators shared feedback via post-workshop surveys, and a subset of 28 participants completed in-depth interviews and a focus group. Results indicate the need for further implementation of professional development such as ours that address linguistic and cultural issues, tailored for K-12 STEM educators. Although participants in this study enumerated several challenges to meeting this need, they also identified opportunities for collaborative solutions that draw upon teacher expertise and are integrated with curricula across content areas.","Hudley, Anne H.

"Purpose Motivated by the perceived disparity between supply and demand for skilled workers in STEM fields, namely, science, technology, engineering and math, the purpose of this paper is to conduct an empirical study of attitude and readiness for STEM education and careers among American and Chinese college students in business disciplines. The authors' findings point out that students in China and the USA have some significantly different perspectives of STEM maybe because they are prepared and inspired differently. These differences may have fundamentally impacted their attitude and readiness for pursuing a STEM career. Implications from this research project should be noteworthy to educators and academic administrators so that appropriate curricula and cultivation can be offered. Design/methodology/approach The authors have decided to look into the situation using a comparison approach by surveying a randomly chosen group of college students from China and another from the USA and then analyzed their responses to the authors' delicately constructed survey in a hope of finding any patterns that may cause the authors to rethink about the authors' approaches to cultivating interest in STEM. Findings The findings described in the paper should offer us some significant, though still preliminary, implications as follows: both American and Chinese students admire STEM careers, but feel rewarding differently; American students may have other career choices that may be equal or more rewarding while Chinese students choose STEM fields by following a cultural norm; having early exposure to science subjects and gaining relevant experience help grow interest in STEM among American students, but such exposure may bring about negative effect on career choices; American female students are at least as capable of succeeding in STEM as their male counterparts; American students seek more advice on their career choices than Chinese students who may follow a cultural norm. Advisory service from teachers and parents may impact differently from peer influence does; extracurricular activities can more positively affect interest in STEM than taking science courses. Research limitations/implications - Although the survey has collected responses from only business students in both countries, the resulting implications should reflect what a sizable segment of college students feel and think about STEM and thus should allow educators and institutional administrators to use as evidence in pursuing innovative curricula and advisory services that would better prepare our future students for STEM education and beyond, especially in those disciplines, like business administration, in which STEM skills are increasingly in demand. Practical implications - Some significant, though still preliminary, implications should be readily drawn from the study: first, both American and Chinese students admire STEM careers, but rewarding may mean different things to them. American students may have other career choices that may be equal or more rewarding per their definition of rewarding while Chinese students may pursue STEM fields by following a cultural norm rather than by considering it rewarding. Second, having early exposure to science subjects and gaining relevant experience can help grow interest in STEM among American students, but such exposure, especially taking science courses, may bring about negative effect on career choices. Extracurricular activities can more positively affect interest in STEM than taking science courses. Third, female students are at least as equally interested and capable of succeeding in STEM as their male counterparts, but their interest and confidence may be more vulnerable to challenges imposed by market reality and cultural bias. Fourth, American students seek more advice when available on their career choices than Chinese students do as the former may face more competing career choices and possess less preparation for STEM than the latter does. Finally, advisory service from teachers and parentsmay impact differently than the influence peers can perpetrate. Club activities when peers can naturally influence each other may be quite effective in promoting interest in and preparing readiness for STEM, and these activities are more effective to American students than Chinese students and to male students than female students. Originality/value Nine hypotheses are proposed to validate through this empirical study. These hypotheses reflect thoughts upon the literature review and pertain to the factors that should impact STEM education.","Rezayat, Fahimeh Sheu, Myron",,"Rezayat, F Sheu, M",111,"[Rezayat, Fahimeh; Sheu, Myron] Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, Carson, CA 90747 USA.",California State University System; California State University Dominguez Hills,,,,,2025-01-19,Business education; Higher education; American students; Chinese students; STEM education and careers; STEM science technology engineering math,10.1108/IJEM-07-2018-0200,Article,,1758-6518,msheu@csudh.edu,126,,,,KA8RV,GENDER,1,INT J EDUC MANAG,Int.

"One of the major challenges faced by the education system today is the lack of interest exhibited by undergraduates in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This is particularly concerning as the world is becoming increasingly technology-driven, and a skilled workforce is necessary to meet future demands. Therefore, fostering interest among undergraduates in STEM fields is imperative to improve their engagement and persistence in these disciplines. Numerous initiatives have been undertaken to enhance students' STEM interests in formal, non-formal, and informal learning settings. However, assessing the effectiveness of these initiatives requires a robust and validated measurement tool grounded in theoretical and empirical evidence. Without a valid and reliable instrument, it would be challenging to determine the effectiveness of these initiatives in promoting STEM education and interest among undergraduates.This study presents a STEM Interest Scale (SIS) that captures diverse psychological factors that affect students' interest in STEM. To develop this scale, the study employs a cross-sectional quantitative design. The data collection process involved two phases for developing and validating the scale. In phase I, 280 participants were surveyed to perform exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify the underlying dimensions of STEM interest. In phase II, a sample of 266 students was used to assess the psychometric characteristics of the 'STEM Interest Scale (SIS) using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and nomological validity. The outcome of the EFA revealed that the STEM Interest scale is comprised of four psychological factors: intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, self-concept, and employment aspiration, while the CFA and nomological network confirm the validity of these factors. The present research is a pioneering effort to holistically capture STEM interest, thereby paving the way for informed interventions in STEM education.","Ahmad, Zubair Sultana, Almaas Siby, Nitha Ammar, Mohammad Al-Thani, Noora J.",,"Ahmad, Z Sultana, A Siby, N Ammar, M Al-Thani, NJ",,"[Ahmad, Zubair; Sultana, Almaas; Siby, Nitha; Ammar, Mohammad; Al-Thani, Noora J.] Qatar Univ, Young Scientists Ctr, Doha 2713, Qatar.",Qatar University,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM Interest; Intrinsic motivation; Self-concept; Self-efficacy; Employment aspiration; Scale validation,10.1007/s10956-024-10140-w,Article; Early Access,JUL 2024,1573-1839,zubairtarar@qu.edu.qa,,,Qatar University,No Statement Available,ZU7M6,TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE; CAREER; EXPERIENCES; VALIDATION; VALIDITY; MODEL,,J SCI EDUC TECHNOL,J.

"Development of an effective strategy for promoting science education and professional development of K-12 science educators is a national priority to strengthen the quality of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This article reports the outcomes of a Geoscience Professional Development Program (GPDP) workshop organized for targeted middle and high school science educators in Forsyth and Guilford County, North Carolina. The objective of the GPDP workshop was to promote hands-on experience for K-12 science educators in the use of modern analytical techniques and instrumentation in geoscience education for the analysis of Salem Lake water in a guided-inquiry setting. Current pedagogy and innovative curriculum development to promote students' success in K-12 science education were also discussed. The expectations and challenges of first-year college students in STEM fields and methods of resolving these challenges were highlighted at the workshop to alert the teachers to the specific areas where more efforts are needed at the K-12 science education level. The workshop also served as an avenue where the specific needs and challenges of classroom instruction and technology in K-12 science education and strategies to resolve these challenges were discussed. The GPDP aimed to transform the knowledge gained from the workshop into the foundation for establishing effective STEM curricula at K-12 schools, ultimately motivating students in pursuing careers in STEM fields. A follow-up survey of GPDP participants indicated that 25% of the participants have already incorporated some aspects of the knowledge gained from the workshop into their courses in the middle and high school curricula. The majority of the participants also found the GPDP to be very exciting and highly beneficial to their professional development.","Fakayode, Sayo O. Pollard, David A. Snipes, Vincent T.

"What are the current challenges and opportunities for bringing actor-network theory (ANT) into issues-based science education? This article discusses experiences gained from introducing an educational version of ANT deploying digital technology into an upper secondary school science class. This teaching innovation, called controversy mapping, has been pioneered in different contexts of higher education before being adapted to school education. Experimenting with controversy mapping in a Swedish science class raised both conceptual and practical issues. These centre on: (1) how ANT-inspired controversy mapping redesigns the citizenship training enacted by institutionalized approaches to issues-based education as socioscientific issues (SSI); (2) how controversy mapping reconfigures the interdisciplinarity of issues-based science education; and (3) how controversy mapping displaces scientific literacy and knowledge of the nature of science as guiding concerns for teaching in favour of new preoccupations with digital literacy and digital tools and methods as contemporary infrastructures of free and open inquiry.","Elam, Mark Solli, Anne Makitalo, Asa",,"Elam, M Solli, A Mäkitalo, Å",61,"[Elam, Mark; Solli, Anne; Makitalo, Asa] Univ Gothenburg, LETStudio, Gothenburg, Sweden.",University of Gothenburg,,,,,2025-01-19,Actor-network theory; citizenship education; controversy mapping; digital technology; interdisciplinary science education; socioscientific issues,10.1080/01596306.2018.1549704,Article,,1469-3739,mark.elam@gu.se,77,,Swedish Research Council [2014-02472]; Swedish Research Council [2014-02472] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council,The authors are most grateful to Radhika Gorur for her valuable editorial guidance and support.

"Given the different migratory flows, studies point to the need to research the living conditions of immigrant children and youths and the procedures used by educational systems to integrate/include them. These proposals highlight the urgency of asking new questions around the approaches and strategies that policies and schools suggest to deal with issues related to the education of students with immigrant backgrounds in order to detect and meet their needs, bring out the tensions and suggest alternatives. Bearing this need in mind, this text introduces the logic guiding a monograph which contains 10 articles from the perspectives of researchers from seven countries which focus on meta-analyses of the studies conducted, the vision of the young migrants, the relationship between educational policies and practices and the evaluation of the educational experiences. These contributions are a chance to situate ourselves, open up new problems, pose challenges and contribute not only to revealing situations but also to changing educational systems' policies and modes of interaction with immigrants.","Hernandez-Hernandez, Fernando Sancho-Gil, Juana M.

"Governments in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are expanding access to high school education, which is a perpetuation of the previous focus on basic education. This study applies qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) using data from seven countries from 2010 to 2020 to examine the potential conditions of fee-free policies at the high school level. Five potential conditions are analyzed. They include the regime type, electoral competition, ideological lineage, economic conditions, and social context. The findings indicate the significant influence of electoral competition and a high level of lower secondary school enrolment for the adoption of fee-free policies. The absence of electoral competition leads to a lack of fee-free policy. The paper explains how elections, one indicator of representative democracy, motivate political leaders to initiate social policies. Additionally, the study challenges the relevance of two important explanations for expansionary social policy in the literature-the partisan theory of policy outcomes, and the economy.","Asante, Gabriel",21582440231184970,"Asante, G",,"[Asante, Gabriel] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.

"Extant research reveals time in nature is causally associated with children's health and well-being, including a child's intra and interpersonal skills, socioemotional growth, physiological function, and cognitive development. In today's neoliberal and COVID-19 era, nature-based solutions, alongside a broader outdoor and experiential learning 'suite' may be well placed as both a vaccine and a salve for our current societal challenges. However, contemporary school education is underpinned by an audit or performative culture evidenced by standardised national testing that may diminish access to outdoor or nature-immersive experiences. Looking forward, the authors contend that contemporary education, and more broadly society, requires nature-rich experiences for a flourishing sustainable future. Drawing upon Foucault, this paper highlights the need to critique education and society's dominant ideologies and practices. These counter-narratives advocate for emancipatory change in contemporary education-especially infusing different voices such as Indigenous knowledges-offered in and through a democratised access to the outdoors.","Dickson, Tracey J.

"The Right-wing populism in Poland faces multiple challenges with respect to Religious Education. This is a complex issue, given it is not only about school education supporting pro-democratic positions in the modern generation of students, but also the fact that today's populists have participated in long-term and complex educational processes of a similar nature. In this sense, the aim of this article is to seek an answer to the question of how Religious Education in Poland-with all of its theoretical and cognitive background rooted in the Christian vision of God and human and the world-can contribute to the elimination of the alliance of the right-wing populist perspectives from the dominant religion of the nation. The article will explain how practical educational opportunities will help students to understand the political strategy of populists, decipher their presentations and approaches, and so shape a positive attitude towards democracy as a desired ideological system within government and social life.","Chrostowski, Mariusz",,"Chrostowski, M",43,"[Chrostowski, Mariusz] Katholische Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Philosoph Padagog Fak, Bayern, Germany.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Religious education; Populism; Democracy; Poland,10.1007/s40839-022-00161-1,Article,FEB 2022,2199-4625,m-chrostowski@wp.pl,62,,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

"Purpose The purpose of this study is to assess how inclusive education affects inclusive economic participation through the financial access channel. Design/methodology/approach The focus is on 42 sub-Saharan African countries with data for the period 2004-2014. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments. Findings The following findings are established. First, inclusive secondary education moderates financial access to exert a positive net effect on female labour force participation. Second, inclusive ""primary and secondary school education"" and inclusive tertiary education modulate financial access for a negative net effect on female unemployment. Third, inclusive secondary education and inclusive tertiary education both moderate financial access for an overall positive net effect on female employment. To provide more gender macroeconomic management policy options, inclusive education thresholds for complementary policies are provided and discussed. Originality/value Policy implications are discussed in the light of challenges of economic development in the sub-region and sustainable development goals.","Asongu, Simplice Nnanna, Joseph Acha-Anyi, Paul",,"Asongu, S Nnanna, J Acha-Anyi, P",481,"[Asongu, Simplice] Univ South Africa, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.

"Healthy lifestyle interventions can improve the physical health of people with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia). Yet, people with SMI report challenges participating in these interventions, thus limiting their potential benefits. This study examined attendance of participants (N = 155), largely comprised of racial and ethnic minorities, in a peer-led healthy lifestyle intervention living in supportive housing. A logistic regression model was used to identify correlates associated with attendance. Results indicated that females, those with at least a high school education, and a diagnosis of schizophrenia were more likely to attend. In contrast, the odds of attending at least one session were significantly lower for those who reported any drug use and for those who rated their health as good or excellent. Our findings indicate certain subgroups of people with SMI could benefit from tailored motivational strategies and supports to improve their participation in healthy lifestyle interventions. clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02175641).","Tuda, Daniela Stefancic, Ana Hawes, Mark Wang, Xiaoyan Guo, Shenyang Cabassa, Leopoldo J.",,"Tuda, D Stefancic, A Hawes, M Wang, XY Guo, SY Cabassa, LJ",761,"[Tuda, Daniela; Hawes, Mark; Wang, Xiaoyan; Guo, Shenyang; Cabassa, Leopoldo J.] Univ St Louis, George Warren Brown Sch Social Work Washington, Goldfarb Hall,Campus Box 1196,One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.

"The present study addresses the limitations and challenges of implementing the non-face-to-face regime in schools in the state public network of Alagoas, analyzing the recent state legislation Portaria/SEDUC No. 4,904 of April 7, 2020; Ordinance/SEDUC No. 7,651 of June 19, which implemented the learning laboratories as a measure to continue the school education of students in the form of remote teaching, contrary to other networks in a country that does not have access to good quality internet in large part. part of its territory of continental dimensions. The theoretical discussion is made in the light of Mascarenhas et al (2020), Silveira and Oliveira et al (2020), Segata (2020), Moran (2000), Silva (2020). The analysis of the legislation allows us to infer that remote teaching in the way it was presented can make it possible to increase inequality between students and the precariousness of teaching work.","do Prado, Edna Cristina dos Santos, Isabela Macena da Silva, Luciene Amaral",,"do Prado, EC dos Santos, IM da Silva, LA",114,"[do Prado, Edna Cristina] Univ Fed Alagoas UFAL, Curso Pedag, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil.

"This paper examines entrepreneurship education in the light of debates about the future of the business school, the nature of the MBA, with which management education is generally synonymous, and the links that need to be created between teaching and research. There is increasing focus on the general utility of entrepreneurial skills and aptitudes (i.e. creativity, independent thinking, opportunity recognition and exploitation, etc.), and it is our contention that entrepreneurship education offers an innovative new paradigm for business school education that answers some of the challenges that are currently levelled against the MBA. Given the breadth of relevance in terms of the issues around Entrepreneurship Education and future pedagogical development in Business Schools, this paper is also well placed as a vehicle to introduce the rest of the coverage in this special issue of TASM. This paper therefore also summarises the papers presented in terms of their contribution to our understanding of the role of entrepreneurship and innovation in higher education. All suggest the need for the broadening of human and social capital, while some propose a fundamental shift in the delivery of professional education.","Binks, M Starkey, K Mahon, CL",,"Binks, M Starkey, K Mahon, CL",1,"Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Inst Enterprise & Innovat, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",University of Nottingham,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1080/09537320500520411,Article,,1465-3990,martin.binks@nottingham.ac.uk,18,,,,013SX,ATTITUDES,1,TECHNOL ANAL STRATEG,Technol.

"The last decade has seen a significant increase of international student mobility and a growing popularity of secondary school exchange programs in the United States and around the world. Drawing upon culture learning theory, the purpose of this study is to understand the impacts, challenges, and rewards of intercultural exchange on secondary school exchange students and their host families. I performed a case study of in-depth interviews with six students who were placed in Hawai'i for an academic year on the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Future Leaders Exchange merit-based scholarships, as well as interviews with their volunteer host families. Findings show that intercultural exchange occurs as a two-way process. Both students and host families reap the benefits of intercultural exchange by way of active interaction and culture sharing that is enhanced by a positive student-host relationship. This study sheds light not only on the experiences of secondary school exchange students but also on the experiences of the volunteer host families.","Sustarsic, Mama",,"Sustarsic, M",912,"[Sustarsic, Mama] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Educ Fdn Dept, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,,,,,2025-01-19,globalization; host families; intercultural exchange; international students; secondary school education,10.32674/jis.v10i4.1042,Article,,2166-3750,msustars@hawaii.edu,933,,,,ON5XF,INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS; INITIAL-STAGE; ABROAD; STRESS,4,J INT STUDENTS,J.

"Gamification of training, the application of gamification to modify training content and methodology, has become a hot topic in corporate training and school education in recent years. However, the relevant key elements have not been identified. Therefore, we aimed to engender and prioritize a list of key elements of effective gamification in the course of corporate training. Using the Delphi method, this study surveyed 14 corporate training gamification experts to evaluate the key elements of gamification - 12 were identified and categorized into six design principles: integration with training goals, rapid feedback, team competition, clear rules, goal-oriented challenges, and freedom to fail. Points and leaderboards were also named as the keys to effective game mechanics. The integration of educational objectives with gamification design, and the balancing between game mechanics and design principles were the conception for gamification in corporate training. This study also provided qualitative data, presenting the rich and differentiated views of corporate training experts regarding the key elements of gamification, to provide some practical tips for teachers in the development of training gamification.","Wang, Yung-Fu Hsu, Ya-Fang Fang, Kwoting",100463,"Wang, YF Hsu, YF Fang, K",,"[Wang, Yung-Fu; Fang, Kwoting] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Management, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan.

"With the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, we are witnessing an unprecedented crisis. In Brazil, the social, political, and economic context points us to a great threat to the democratic life model, and on the other hand, the pandemic context has unveiled great social and educational problems, explicitly the disparities and differences in access to education, health, and technologies. Based on these premises, we developed a reflection based on a qualitative analysis, as to the approach to the problem; reconstructive, critical and hermeneutic, as to the objectives; and bibliographic, regarding the procedures, which are anchored in authors linked to the theme, but especially, to the ideas and concepts pointed out by Ball, Maguire and Braun (2016). The text was divided into two moments: in the first, we reflect on the exclusionary context, aggravated by the pandemic and, in the second, we point out the school political actions based on the access to education as a right and the contributions to the current scenario, putting into perspective an equitable, democratic, emancipating, humanized and sensitive education.","Marcelino, Patricia Carlesso Kohls, Rosana Cristina Copatti, Carina",,"Marcelino, PC Kohls, RC Copatti, C",331,"[Marcelino, Patricia Carlesso] Univ Passo Fundo UPF RS, Grp Pesquisa GEPES GEEDE, Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil.

"Despite the rapid increase in international students in the education sector, this area remains an under-researched. In Australia, many schools welcome international learners, but are also aware that the support they can offer cannot fully address the student's needs. Drawing on surveys (n = 51) and focus group interviews (n = 16), this case study considers how Chinese international students at four Australian schools understand their everyday experiences. The findings show that students learn and socialise in ways that make sense to them, based on their observations and interpretations of everyday events. Although the support from the school, teachers, and local peers were appreciated, they did not completely solve students' problems, nor were they necessarily interpreted and accepted by our participants as intended. It is important for educators to develop a more nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by international students in everyday life, and the kind of support that the students need.","Zhang, Hongzhi Chan, Philip Wing Keung God, Yu Tim",807,"Zhang, HZ Chan, PWK God, YT",,"[Zhang, Hongzhi; Chan, Philip Wing Keung; God, Yu Tim] Monash Univ, Sch Educ Culture & Soc, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Monash University,,,,,2025-01-19,international students; Confucian Heritage Culture learner; school education; cultural differences,10.3390/educsci11120807,Article,,2227-7102,hongzhi.zhang@monash.edu,,,Xin Jin Shan Education Foundation Inc.

"The study's research question was how a one-year initial teacher education (ITE) programme could equip prospective teachers for present needs and local challenges and the demands of a fast-changing world. To this end the study explored the perceptions and experiences of student teachers who were enrolled in an ITE programme for secondary school education at a metropolitan university in South Africa. Data were generated via focus-group interviews, reflective journals, individual interviews, and questionnaires. The findings are that the student teachers developed beginner knowledge for practice, grasped the significance of reflective practice, developed a basic understanding of the complexities of teaching, and felt ill-equipped to employ a basic repertoire of pedagogical skills/tools. The implications of the study propose that a one-year ITE programme would benefit from having a sharp focus. Supporting pre-service teachers towards developing adaptive expertise in relation to becoming ""learning specialists"" is proposed as an organising framework for a one-year teacher preparation programme.","Gravett, Sarah Kroon, Rika",,"Gravett, S Kroon, R",861,"[Gravett, Sarah] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Educ, Johannesburg, South Africa.

"There is a growing body of literature which marks out a feminist ethics of care and it is within this framework we understand transitions from primary to secondary school education can be challenging and care-less, especially for disabled children. By exploring the narratives of parents and professionals, we investigate transitions and self-identity, as a meaningful transition depends on the care-full spaces pupils inhabit. These education narratives are all in the context of privileging academic attainment and a culture of testing and examinations. Parents and professionals, as well as children are also surveyed. Until there are care-full education processes, marginalisation will remain, impacting on disabled children's transition to secondary school and healthy identity construction. Moreover, if educational challenges are not addressed, their life chances are increasingly limited. Interdependent caring work enables engagement in a meaningful education and positive identity formation. In school and at home, care-full spaces are key in this process.","Lithari, Eleni Rogers, Chrissie",,"Lithari, E Rogers, C",259,"[Lithari, Eleni] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Sch Educ & Social Care, Chelmsford, Essex, England.

"Historically, science has become an obstacle to the introduction of other kinds of knowledge in schools. Since 1990, the superiority of scientific knowledge has been criticized by education researchers. In parallel, indigenous education has been proving itself as a privileged space of recognition of relationships among cultural groups, in a way that traditional types of knowledge have been incorporated into the school curriculum, bringing other challenges to the pedagogical work. In this paper, we discuss a case study in which traditional types of knowledge were part of a course from the Undergraduate Program for Indigenous Educators at Federal University of Minas Gerais. We collected interrelated situations involving food planting and astronomical observations under various conceptions, and we developed them in a dialogic form in the classroom. The strengthening of indigenous cultures was rethought as the interlocution kept made us see the viability of the cultural dialogue in its complexity. We hope to contribute to overcome the dichotomy between scientific knowledge and traditional culture in the curricular propositions of indigenous and non- indigenous school education.","Valadares, Juarez Melgaco da Silveira Junior, Celio",,"Valadares, JM da Silveira, C",,"[Valadares, Juarez Melgaco; da Silveira Junior, Celio] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,,,,,2025-01-19,Indigenous Education; Science Teaching; Interculturality,10.14507/epaa.28.4699,Article,,1068-2341,julianeangnes@gmail.com; celio@fae.ufmg.br,,,,,OJ3QY,,,ED POLICY ANAL ARCH,Educ.

"Many education systems have recognized the importance of computational thinking and coding skills and are implementing curricular changes to introduce coding into formal school education. A necessary and critical success factor involves the preparation of and support for teachers to teach coding. Thus, understanding the perceptions of teachers towards coding is most important, together with knowing the kinds of support they received, and their readiness and challenges to teach. The purpose of the current study is to compare teachers' attitudes towards the importance of information and communications technologies (ICT) skills and coding skills in Finland, Mainland China, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea. The findings indicate that teachers in Finland, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea believe that coding is useful even if students will not work in ICT jobs while Mainland Chinese teachers are undecided. Mainland China, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea have more positive views towards how to prepare for future-ready learners.","Wu, Longkai Looi, Chee-Kit Multisilta, Jari How, Meng-Leong Choi, Hyungshin Hsu, Ting-Chia Tuomi, Pauliina",,"Wu, LK Looi, CK Multisilta, J How, ML Choi, H Hsu, TC Tuomi, P",21,"[Wu, Longkai; Looi, Chee-Kit; How, Meng-Leong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.

"Introduction: Educators play a pivotal role in shaping students' academic achievements, particularly in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. The instructional techniques employed by teachers significantly impact students' decisions to pursue or persist in STEM disciplines. This research aims to explore the challenges faced by high school STEM teachers in Qatar in delivering effective STEM instruction. Methods: Data was collected through a survey administered to 290 high school STEM teachers across thirty-nine schools in Qatar. The survey targeted teachers in the 11th and 12th grades. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to analyze the data and examine teachers' perceived barriers to effective STEM instruction. Results: The findings revealed various barriers hindering STEM instruction. These barriers were categorized into school-related, student-related, technology-related, and teaching-related factors. All the hypothesized teaching barriers [i.e., (student-related: beta = -0.243, p < 0.001); (school-related: beta = -0.122, p < 0.001), (technologyrelated: beta = -0.123, p = 0.040); and (instruction-related: beta = -0.112, p < 0.018)] were negatively related to teachers' STEM teaching. Among the various obstacles, it appears that the most formidable challenges for high school STEM teachers are related to students (beta = -0.243, p < 0.001). Discussion: Understanding these barriers is crucial for informing educational policies and developing strategies to enhance STEM learning in Qatar's high schools. Addressing these barriers is essential to provide adequate resources, professional development opportunities, and support systems. By addressing these challenges, Qatar can foster a conducive environment for effective STEM instruction, thereby nurturing a future generation of STEM professionals.","Sellami, Abdellatif Santhosh, Malavika Bhadra, Jolly Ahmad, Zubair",1333669,"Sellami, A Santhosh, M Bhadra, J Ahmad, Z",,"[Sellami, Abdellatif; Santhosh, Malavika] Qatar Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Res Ctr, Doha, Qatar.

"The paper examines how prolonged armed conflict in Jammu and Kashmir affects both education and children. Utilizing a descriptive qualitative survey methodology, the study delves into the multifaceted experiences of the diverse educational stakeholders while analyzing the underlying factors that shape their perspectives. Empirical findings strongly suggest that while there is no universal formula for peace education in conflict contexts, a crucial element lies in establishing supportive classrooms that address the unique challenges experienced by students and teachers. The study's implications have broad significance, offering valuable insights for policymakers and humanitarian organizations seeking a deeper understanding of the adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) faced by communities in conflict-affected areas. Implementing peace education at the school level can help alleviate the impact of conflict on students and teachers, but addressing the broader context of insecurity requires attention to political, security, social, and economic factors, with schools serving as a potential arena for specific aspects of peace education.","Ilyas, Mohammad",,"Ilyas, M",,"[Ilyas, Mohammad] Natl Inst Educ Planning & Adm, Dept Sch Stand & Evaluat, New Delhi, India.",National University of Educational Planning & Administration - India,,,,,2025-01-19,Peace education; armed conflict; Jammu and Kashmir; school education; childhood; aspirations,10.1080/17400201.2024.2433783,Article; Early Access,DEC 2024,1740-021X,mohammadilyas@niepa.ac.in,,,,,O2Z8T,RISK; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; LIMITS,,J PEACE EDUC,J.

"There is a general consensus that reading competencies, being acore element of basic education, are an essential prerequisite for the acquisition, organization, and application of knowledge in various subjects and domains. Thus, reading competencies represent akey factor for educational and professional success, lifelong learning, and social participation.

Because there is evidence that ashare of these poor readers may have limited basic reading abilities that underlie text comprehension, in the second part of this article we review meta-analyses on the relations between cognitive skills and reading competence.

"In the past several decades, women have made considerable progress toward gender equity in the USA, but women in general and women of color in particular continue to be underrepresented in some fields of STEM, notably engineering and computing. Women of color in these fields are also underrepresented in the STEM education research literature. In this article, we review the literature on sociocultural theory and empirical research grounded in it to propose a framework for thinking about how young women of color encounter and experience engineering and computing in local educational contexts, and how their encounters and experiences might be enhanced and lead to more sustained interests and identities in these fields. The framework motivates an examination of the interrelationships among institutional practices, normative discourses, identities, interactional dynamics, and experience-near external exclusions in the contexts of the young women's lives. As such, our concerns are less with provision of thecontentper se of engineering or computing and more with the structure, organization, and discourses of the educational contexts in which the groundwork is laid for the development of interests and identities related to these fields. We briefly review significant challenges faced by middle and high school girls and young women of color as they encounter in-school and out-of-school practices and interactional dynamics related to engineering and computing, respond to local and societal discourses circulating about these fields, form social and personal identities with respect to these fields, and grapple with external exclusions, e.g., undocumented legal status and unresponsive institutions, affecting pursuit of engineering and computing. We then examine ways in which scholars taking sociocultural approaches have addressed these challenges through action research. Next, we assess the promise and limitations of these efforts in overcoming the challenges. Due to the sociocultural perspective that frames our approach, the research methodology used in the work we review is primarily qualitative, and the approach to action is primarily participatory action research. We conclude the paper with a preliminary synthesis of research on the sociocultural system in which young women of color in the USA and Canada encounter and pursue engineering and computing, including its foundational components in mathematics and science education. We argue that this system repeatedly plays out in unequal opportunity structures, deficit discourses, marginalizing interactions, conflicting identity demands, and external exclusions for many young women of color. The system carries expectancies that make sustained participation in engineering and computing risky and difficult, even if these young women have interest, ability, or ambitions to pursue these fields. We propose a program of response to these barriers, based in sociocultural practice theory.","Eisenhart, Margaret Allen, Carrie D.",,"Eisenhart, M Allen, CD",793,"[Eisenhart, Margaret] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, POB 4615, Boulder, CO 80306 USA.

"Background Across the globe, there have been significant reforms to improve STEM education at all levels. A significant part of this has been teacher reform. While the responses and resilience of STEM teachers to educational reforms in secondary education have received significant attention, the responses and resilience of STEM teachers in higher education remains understudied. In higher education, educational reforms of academic roles have seen increasing numbers of STEM academics focussed on education. Responses of STEM academics to education reform of the academic role have some parallels with teacher resilience, but there are also potential misalignments within a culture which values and prioritises science disciplinary research. This study examined the responses of STEM academics in higher education to educational reform of the academic role using the theoretical construct of resilience and Bronfenbrenner's socio-ecological model. This was a 2-year case study of 32 academics and senior educational leaders in higher education in STEM. Data collection included semi-structured interviews which were theme coded and inductively analysed. Results The responses and resilience of STEM academics focussed on education appeared to be dependent on interactions between individual disposition in the microsystem and influences of the exosystem and the external macrosystem. Five major themes emerged about the value and quality, scholarship and expertise, progress and mobility, status and identity and community and culture of STEM academics focussed on education. The exosystem was a significant unidirectional influence on STEM academics where judgements were made concerning academic performance, awards, and promotion. Responses of senior leaders in the exosystem were influenced by the macrosystem and culture of science. Academics focussed on research, rather than education were more valued and more likely to be both financially rewarded and promoted. Conclusion During this pressured decade, where COVID-19 has intensified stress, more attention on the direction and reciprocal relationships in the socio-ecological model of higher education is needed in order for educational reform in higher education STEM to be effective. Resilience of STEM academics to educational reform in higher education is a dynamic quality, and the capacity to ""bounce back"", learn from challenges, and realise expectations of educational reform will depend on an understanding of resilience and support of Bronfenbrenner's spheres of influence.","Ross, Pauline Mary Scanes, E.

"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has helped shine the spotlight on the role of women's leadership in tackling the world's health and health system challenges. The proportion of women occupying senior leadership positions in the health sector is less compared to males, even as they constitute a vast majority of the work force. The South Indian state of Kerala is an exception to this trend, a phenomenon that we sought to understand and contextualise. We undertook a study to understand the personal and professional journeys of some women leaders in the Kerala health sector to determine the antecedents of their leadership positions, the challenges that came their way in leadership, and strategies adopted to overcome these challenges. We also investigated into how these experiences shaped their styles and approaches to leadership. Methods We conducted a qualitative study involving semi-structured in-depth interviews with women leaders. Sixteen women leaders were identified from public records and through peer nomination and interviewed in their language of preference following written informed consent procedures. Interviews focused on participants' professional and personal trajectories, work-life balance, style of leadership, challenges, enablers, lessons learned in their path, and their vision for the health system. The interviews conducted in Malayalam were transliterated into English and thematically analysed using Atlas.Ti8 software by three researchers. Results Our study participants were aged 40 to around 80 years, from 8 out of 14 districts of the state. Women leaders in Kerala's health sector faced challenges through the life-course: during their early school education, in professional service as well as in their roles as leaders. There were myriad experiences - including gender stereotyping and discrimination at the intersection of gender and other social identities. Women developed manifold ways of overcoming them and evolve unique - and again myriad-leadership styles. Conclusions Women leaders in Kerala have faced shared challenges through their life-course to climb up the ranks of leadership; each leader has adopted unique ways of overcoming them and developed similarly unique leadership styles. At each life stage there were bargains with patriarchy - involving family members (often as allies), against formal and informal institutional rules, managers, peers and subordinates., which in turn suggests a feminist consciousness on the part of Kerala women leaders as well as the society in which they are seeking to lead.","Nambiar, Devaki Benny, Gloria Sankar, Hari D.",146,"Nambiar, D Benny, G Sankar, DH",,"[Nambiar, Devaki; Benny, Gloria; Sankar, Hari D.] George Inst Global Hlth, New Delhi, India.

"The USA has recently experienced an unprecedented boom in domestic, on-shore oil and gas production via unconventional drilling technologies like hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling. Community leaders and policy-makers claim that this boom holds much promise to reverse many social and economic challenges faced by rural, non-amenity counties. Chief among these is human capital flight-often called the ""rural brain drain""-and the loss of working-age population. This analysis examines the socio-demographic consequences of the oil and gas boom by assessing if the boom can stall or reverse human capital flight and the loss of working-age population from rural, non-amenity counties. Using a large data set of U.S. counties and difference-in-difference models, we find that the oil and gas boom is associated with modest increases in the proportion of county population with a high school education or less and modest losses in the proportion of county population with a college education. The boom likely increased the proportion of working age population, particularly males 20-34. Overall, our results suggest that oil and gas development has a limited effect on human capital and age composition in non-amenity, rural counties. Broadly, we expect that oil and gas development will do little to address long-run, structural demographic challenges facing rural America.","Mayer, Adam Malin, Stephanie A.

"The Kenyan education system has very limited re-entry options for learners who drop out before attaining secondary school certificate. It is very difficult to access training and or secure a job that requires at least secondary school education. This study examined the prospects of initiating Open and Distance e-Learning(ODeL) in re-entry programmes into high school for out of school Young Adult Secondary School Dropouts (Y.A.S.S.D). The study focused on the enablers and challenges of initiating ODeL in the secondary school re-entry programmes. An alternative flexible and sustainable community based ODeL model that potentially can address re-entry for the Y.A.S.S.D is proposed. A qualitative phenomenological design was used; focus group discussion and interviews were conducted from a purposeful sample of participants. The study revealed that the potential of ODeL in addressing re-entry into secondary school for Y.A.S.S.D great. Majority of the participants were aware of the existing secondary school re-entry options, however, ODeL appeared new. Despite there being challenges in introducing the ODeL mode of study in secondary school re-entry programmes, it is viable and requires further exploration. The enablers of this mode of study are largely in place to the extent appreciated by participants in the study.","Musita, Richard Ogange, Betty O.

"Background: This study examined the relationships of various teacher retention factors with the intentions of math and science teachers to remain in the profession. With data collected from the 2007-08 Schools and Staffing Survey, a sample of 6588 secondary math and science teachers across public schools in the USA was used for structural equation modeling. Results: Socioeconomic impact, student truancy, and years of experience all showed direct relationships with teacher autonomy, while administrative support, teacher autonomy, and satisfaction with salary were all directly related to these teachers intentions to remain in the profession. Of these teacher retention factors, satisfaction with salary was found to have the strongest relationship. Conclusions: By understanding what factors are associated with the intentions of math and science teachers to continue teaching, educational policymakers and practitioners will have practical guidance in helping them make decisions to improve the retention of these teachers in secondary public schools, on whom the fields in STEM are so dependent.","McConnell, John R., III",7,"McConnell, III",,"[McConnell, John R., III] Austin Peay State Univ, Dept Educ Specialties, POB 4545, Clarksville, TN 37044 USA.",Austin Peay State University,,,,,2025-01-19,Math and science teachers; Satisfaction with salary; Structural equation modeling; Teacher retention,10.1186/s40594-017-0061-8,Article,,,mcconnellj@apsu.edu,,,,,GR6JB,SELF-EFFICACY; 1ST-YEAR TEACHERS; JOB-SATISFACTION; SCHOOL TEACHERS; PUBLIC-SCHOOLS; RETENTION; ACHIEVEMENT; CHALLENGES; SHORTAGES; ATTRITION,,INT J STEM EDUC,Int.

"Gifted students may be at risk of school disengagement due to lacking intellectual challenges. Four talent centers were established to offer makerspace enrichment programs, because makerspace activities promote engagement and science, mathematics, and technology learning. In the current study, we investigated gifted students' experiences with makerspace enrichment programs in Norway in terms of social aspects, learning aspects and teacher support aspects. We conducted semistructured interviews with 15 participants (15-16 years) from four different talent centers across the country. Findings suggested that the informants had an overall positive experience of participation and that most were more engaged at talent centers than at their home schools. In addition, the makerspace approaches seemed to suit gifted learners' need for more complex subject content and facilitate interaction with peers and teachers with similar content knowledge/interest. We concluded that makerspace activities at talent centers constitute an important supplement to ordinary school for gifted students.","Smedsrud, Jorgen Hammer Bungum, Berit Flo, Ellen Egeland",,"Smedsrud, JH Bungum, B Flo, EE",,"[Smedsrud, Jorgen Hammer] Norwegian Business Sch BI, Dept Commun & Culture, Nydalsveien 37, N-0484 Oslo, Norway.

"Starting early in life, children, especially girls, experience obstacles when it comes to developing an interest in STEM. Although early childhood (EC) educators face an important task in promoting girls (and boys) in STEM, they often face challenges in doing so. Therefore, it is crucial for EC educators to cultivate positive attitudes, self-concepts, and STEM skills. To address these identified issues, a three-month professional development program was created for EC educators. This professional development program was evaluated using a pre-post design with a focus on the self-concept and gender stereotypes of EC educators. The program involved 30 female EC educators in evaluating these aspects. The statistical analyses show positive results in enhancing educators' self-concepts and reducing gender stereotypes over the course of this professional development program. The results suggest the potential of the blended learning design in this professional development program and indicate that this program could serve as a promising model for future interventions.","Feierabend, Sarah Hasenhuetl, Sabine Paechter, Manuela Luttenberger, Silke Eglmaier, Marina W.

"The paper aims to examine the persistence of gender stereotypes in STEM education and identify opportunities to enhance the inclusivity and attractiveness of Vocational Education. The analytical part of the paper consists of quantitative and qualitative research. Through ordinal logistic regression, the determinants influencing female and male students' attitudes towards gender stereotypes and future careers in STEM fields are analysed. The qualitative part draws on focus group outputs to understand the challenges of this topic in greater depth. University students are more resistant to stereotypes than high school students. At the same time, men tend to believe in gender stereotypes more than women and nonbinary people. An important aspect is positive female role models, which eliminate this adverse persistent phenomenon and increase the inclusiveness of the learning environment for female students. University students are more likely to envision a future in STEM than high school students, and there were no statistically significant differences in the plans of male and female students. Non-binary students are more likely to choose a career in a different field.","Simovicova, Simona Urbancikova, Natasa",,"Simovicová, S Urbanciková, N",29,"[Simovicova, Simona; Urbancikova, Natasa] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Kosice, Slovakia.",Technical University Kosice,,,,,2025-01-19,gender stereotypes; gender equality; education; vocational education,,Article,,,simona.simovicova@tuke.sk; natasa.urbancikova@tuke.sk,44,,,,CK4D7,,4,MANAG RES PRACT,Manag.

"In this article, we reflect on our experience applying a framework for evaluating systems change to an evaluation of a statewide West Virginia alliance funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve the early persistence of rural, first-generation, and other underrepresented minority science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students in their programs of study. We begin with a description of the project and then discuss the two pillars around which we have built our evaluation of this project. Next, we present the challenge we confronted (despite the utility of our two pillars) in identifying and analyzing systems change, as well as the literature we consulted as we considered how to address this difficulty. Finally, we describe the framework we applied and examine how it helped us and where we still faced quandaries. Ultimately, this reflection serves two key purposes: 1) to consider a few of the challenges of measuring changes in systems and 2) to discuss our experience applying one framework to address these issues.","Howley, Caitlin Campbell, Johnavae Cowley, Kimberly Cook, Kimberly",10982140211041606,"Howley, C Campbell, J Cowley, K Cook, K",632,"[Howley, Caitlin; Campbell, Johnavae; Cowley, Kimberly; Cook, Kimberly] ICF, 9300 Lee Hwy, Fairfax, VA 22031 USA.",,,,,,2025-01-19,systems change; STEM education; broadening participation,10.1177/10982140211041606,Article,JAN 2022,1557-0878,caitlin.howley@icf.com,646,,"National Science Foundation [HRD-1834586, HRD-1834595, HRD-1834601, HRD-1834575, HRD-1834569]","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant nos.

"In Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, identity and belonging are affected by how students view themselves as belonging in STEM or not. The movement to help students understand that anyone can be successful in STEM is an incredibly important one. However, how students construct their identities within STEM is important for maintaining their engagement within STEM fields over time. If we condition students to expect positive feedback for having an aptitude in a STEM field early-on, what I deem genius culture, we risk helping these students develop resilience when faced with challenges. Although, if we tell students that everyone can succeed in STEM, we risk deflating students who are gifted or talented in STEM and equating growth/improvement as mastery, thereby discouraging inquiry. Moreover, as instructors, our own sense of STEM-self affects how we teach and reward our students for their successes. A more sustainable goal is to make students aware of their STEM-self and help students bolster their sense of belonging in STEM rather than acknowledging only their perceived successes or failures.","Bowman Jr, Larry L.",1159417,"Bowman, LL",,"[Bowman Jr, Larry L.] Univ Georgia, Marine Inst, Sapelo Isl, GA 31327 USA.

"CREATE (Consider, Read, Elucidate hypotheses, Analyze and interpret data, Think of the next Experiment) is a pedagogical approach for teaching and learning science through the rigorous analysis of primary scientific literature. This mini-review focuses on the tools, assignments, and in-class activities by which this strategy immerses students in the process of science and further challenges students to embody the intellectual activities of actual scientists. We highlight the innovative ways in which CREATE pedagogy encourages students to think deeply about science. Applying this strategy has been shown to promote student gains in cognitive and affective behaviors while also fostering the development of science process skills. Herein we also provide a case study of CREATE implementation, which provides a detailed perspective on the realities of teaching with this strategy.

"This study examined a new form of pervasive gender inequality: the gender gap among high achievers in math and considered its implication for developing STEM talents. Using the cross-nation Programme for International Student Achievement (PISA) data from both 2003 and 2012, we examined the mathematics gender gap among 15-year-old high achievers across ten countries/regions. We showed a consistent male advantage among the top performers in mathematics. Follow-up regression analyses revealed that the gap was associated with some socio-demographic and schooling/attitudinal variables, even after controlling for the background variables. We argue that education communities should acknowledge and address this form of gender inequality, as it could have ramifications for the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education pipeline. Educators and society in general still face challenges in closing the gender gap among high achievers in math with an aim to develop a gender-balanced STEM talent pool.","Zhou, Yisu Fan, Xitao Wei, Xiaoxin Tai, Robert H.",,"Zhou, YS Fan, XT Wei, XX Tai, RH",259,"[Zhou, Yisu; Fan, Xitao] Univ Macau, Fac Educ E33, Room 3022,Av Univ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.

"This work explores the mathematical modelling capabilities of various iterations of ChatGPT, focusing on their performance across tasks of differing complexity and openness. The study examines the abilities of GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, and a more instructed version, GPT-MM, in multiple scenarios. It is observed that all versions demonstrate basic mathematical problem-solving skills. However, their effectiveness varies with increasing task complexity. While GPT-4.0 and GPT-MM show marginal improvements in providing detailed solutions, significant challenges persist, especially in moderate to complex modelling contexts where comprehending the nuances of tasks becomes challenging. Additionally, the study suggests that the openness of modelling tasks has a limited impact on performance, highlighting that mathematical and contextual complexities play more critical roles. The implications of these observations are discussed in terms of potential enhancements to teaching methodologies and the integration of AI tools like GPT in educational settings. This reiterates the importance of further research to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of AI tools and ensure their effective use in education.","Spreitzer, Carina Straser, Oliver Zehetmeier, Stefan Maass, Katja",698,"Spreitzer, C Straser, O Zehetmeier, S Maass, K",,"[Spreitzer, Carina; Zehetmeier, Stefan] Univ Klagenfurt, Inst Instruct, Sch Dev, Sterneckstr 15, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria.

"A unique team of personnel from federal, private, and international organizations has worked together over the past seven years to locate the remains of the Bonhomme Richard (BHR), one of the original ships of the U.S. Continental Navy commanded by Captain John Paul Jones and lost in the North Sea in 1779. While the team has yet to discover the wreckage, it has demonstrated the effective capabilities and value of state-of-the-art technology to image and survey objects on the bottom of the North Sea. Perhaps, more importantly, it has demonstrated that people from disparate organizations and militaries can work together effectively and efficiently with minimal overhead and bureaucracy. The work to date has paved the way toward eventual location and recovery of the BHR, but it has also demonstrated a partnership model that should be explored in other venues as we seek to increase our knowledge of the changing ocean environment.

Within K-12 organizations, some practices may be perceived as mundane, but storytelling supports transformation toward achieving equitable STEM learning opportunities in a school. Therefore, storytelling is a means for achieving organizational resilience.Methods Through a comparative case study design, this paper explores challenges identified by educational leaders through focus groups who worked with teams to activate interdisciplinary learning to support thriving STEM programming to enhance equitable science instruction.Results We characterize STEM systems' social and organizational phenomena from three educational contexts. We start by sharing these systems' backgrounds and educational goals, with specific attentiveness to their STEM programming. We then share the stories told by their leaders to promote organizational resilience (these characteristics, as previously described, are italicized throughout this section) within each of the given contexts.Discussion The STEM stories in this study shared the state of STEM within a school and district, the instructional mission of STEM, and a community STEM story.","Marshall, Stefanie L.

"This study investigates the impact of integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies with Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR-AR) in didactic applications within the AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations) field. To address this gap, a systematic literature review (SLR) analyzed 30 primary studies, providing a comprehensive overview for teachers and researchers interested in a deeper exploration of the area. The results indicate that the educational implementation of BIM VR-AR has garnered the interest of researchers across various contexts and applications, fostering novel forms of communication and representation. Positive outcomes are notable in terms of motivation and spatial cognitive skills development. In this context, avatar mapping and presence in virtual environments are closely linked to immersion, social presence, and cognitive load. However, challenges such as teacher and student training, costs, interoperability, and device usability persist. The emergence of mobile immersive VR technologies shows promise in mitigating some of these barriers, contributing to realizing the didactic potential of these technologies in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education.","Rocha, Luciana Sandrini Krassmann, Aliane Loureiro Notare, Marcia Rodrigues Vidotto, Kajiana Nuernberg Sartor",,"Rocha, LS Krassmann, AL Notare, MR Vidotto, KNS",,"[Rocha, Luciana Sandrini; Notare, Marcia Rodrigues; Vidotto, Kajiana Nuernberg Sartor] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Informat Educ, Porto Alegre, Brazil.

"STEM education is an approach that aims to respond to the demands of a highly digitized society with emerging problems that cannot be solved from a single disciplinary field. In Colombia, initiatives have proliferated from diffe-rent sectors, still isolated and with few reports in higher education, particularly in initial teacher training. Therefore, this article aimed to analyze the understandings and appropriations of the STEM/STEAM educational approach in the country from a perspective of professional training. To this effect, a critical review of undergraduate works was carried out based on the following categories: purposes, acronyms and denominations; levels of integration; lear-ning objectives; and implementation strategies. As a result, a preference for using the STEM acronym was found, and interdisciplinarity was highlighted as the level of integration sought in the design of classroom experiences, but, at the same time, challenges for achieving it were recognized, as well as discussions that are still limited regarding the in which could be established between the of the STEM/STEAM acronym.","Marin-Rios, Alejandra Cano-Villa, Jessica Mazo-Castaneda, Alejandra",,"Marin-Ríos, A Cano-Villa, J Mazo-Castañeda, A",55,"[Marin-Rios, Alejandra; Cano-Villa, Jessica; Mazo-Castaneda, Alejandra] Univ Antioquia, Medellin Antioquia, Colombia.",Universidad de Antioquia,,,,,2025-01-19,critical review; initial teacher training; interdisciplinarity; final graduation works; professional training; STEM approach,10.14483/23448350.20473,Review,,2344-8350,alejandra.marinr@udea.edu.co; jessica.canov@udea.edu.co; alejandra.mazo1@udea.edu.co,70,,,,L2SW4,,2,REV CIENT-COLOMBIA,Rev.

"People of Mexican origin in the United States have long experienced discrimination in wages, housing, and schooling, which directly impacts their participation in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workforce. Using interviews of Latina scientists and teachers, autoethnography, family and newspaper archives, and history and social science research, I reflect on key aspects of Mexican and Mexican American history that contribute to the challenges faced by Latinos in the US educational system today. Analysis of my own educational trajectory reveals the hidden part that teacher role models in my community and in my family played in my journey to becoming a scientist. Latina teachers and faculty, middle school science programs, and the provisioning of stipends for undergraduate researchers are emphasized as strategies for increasing student retention and success.

"In this mixed-methods study, we performed content analysis on openended survey items to reveal primary themes related to how PhD students are responding to the Trump policies and the COVID-19 pandemic. In our data set, 40.7% of the respondents reported that their career plans have been affected by Trump's antiscience policies, 54.5% by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study revealed three themes, which were (1) awareness of the reduced funding for STEM (science, engineering, technology, and mathematics) and higher education, (2) heightened awareness of and commitment to the pursuit of social and racial justice, (3) interest in seeking job opportunities abroad. The top three themes for the COVID-19 pandemic were (1) shifting graduation timelines and adjusting research to the virtual campus life; (2) losing jobs, concerning about hiring freezes and fewer job openings; and (3) reconsidering their place in a STEM field postpandemic, including a possible complete change in career plans; thoughts of leaving the country for international jobs.","McGee, Ebony Fang, Yuan Ni, Yibin (Amanda) Monroe-White, Thema",23328584211039217,"McGee, E Fang, Y Ni, Y Monroe-White, T",,"[McGee, Ebony] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Divers & STEM Educ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.

"""Lesson study"" has garnered considerable attention from educational researchers and practitioners as a promising method for improving instruction. At its core, lesson study reflects a collaborative inquiry process, grounded in cycles of planning, enacting, and reflecting, that promotes teacher learning through active engagement in lesson refinement. In this article, we leverage lesson study as an exemplar case to foreground an examination and application of theory-based evaluation. We overview a novel evaluation framework contextualized to this multidimensional instructional program and draw out the contributions of theory-based evaluation to the study of program effects. To ground the description of this framework, we summarize representative findings from our ongoing evaluation of a lesson study-based instructional program and discuss processes for selecting, using, and managing evidence sources as well as determining causal strands supporting program outcomes. We conclude by discussing lessons learned and implications for theory-based evaluation of complex programs.","Follmer, D.

"The paper aims to analyze the educational trends of the year 2022 and determine whether they are relevant in the future, whether they are a response to the challenges of the present. Also, attention is paid to the method of SWOT-analysis, with the help of which the strengths and vulnerabilities of distance learning are identified. The results analyze the future of distance education, in particular, special attention is paid to the experience of implementing hybrid education as a likely promising direction of further learning. Another aspect is the introduction of STEM education, media education (as a counteraction to intentional propaganda), and Education for Sustainable Development as important elements of the modern learning process in the United States and European countries. In conclusion, it is concluded that these areas of educational activities will be trends in the next decade in the recurrence of the crisis. The scientific novelty of the work consists in the fact that for the first time at the synthetic level modern educational trends were studied, their prospects and risks of use were characterized.","Gumennykova, Tamara Ilchenko, Petro Bazyl, Olena Ilchenko, Alla Vydrych, Olena",,"Gumennykova, T Ilchenko, P Bazyl, O Ilchenko, A Vydrych, O",226,"[Gumennykova, Tamara] PJSC IAPM Univ, Interreg Acad Personnel Management, Dept Social Sci, Danube Branch, Kiev, Ukraine.

"This descriptive qualitative study used racialized organizations (Ray, 2019) as a lens to examine how 27 faculty, administrators, and postdoctoral fellows in STEM departments at two institutions understood the problems that underlie negative racial climate, the strategies they used to improve racial climate, and the alignment between problems and solutions. Participants did not discuss racism and White supremacy as factors that contribute to negative racial climate. Instead, they indicated a weak STEM pipeline, and lack of faculty engagement created negative climate. Because participants did not attend to how racism and White supremacy fostered negative climate, their strategies (e.g., increased recruitment, committees, workshops) left systemic racism intact and (un)intentionally amplified labor for racially minoritized graduate students and faculty champions who often led change efforts with little support. These findings can help move departments away from intervention-centered models of change and toward more systemic approaches that contest how racialized organizations operate.","Perez, Rosemary J.

"Augmented Reality (AR) has become a key technology in the education sector, offering interactive learning experiences that improve student engagement and understanding. Despite its increasing use, a thorough summary of AR research in educational environments is still required. This study applies bibliometric analysis to identify trends in this research field. Data from the Scopus database and VOSviewer software version 1.6.19 was used to analyze academic publications from 2018 to 2023. The original dataset of 4858 articles was narrowed down to 1109 articles concentrating on ""augmented reality"" AND ""simulation"" in student learning. Methods such as advanced data mining, co- citation analysis, and network visualization were utilized to outline the structure and trends in this research area. Key findings include a significant rise in research activity over the past decade, identification of the ten most prolific authors in AR simulation studies, and detailed visualizations of information distribution. Significant challenges include high costs and difficulties in technical integration. The study addresses these issues through interdisciplinary research that combines educational theory with AR technology. Results demonstrate growing interest in AR applications, particularly within STEM education, driven by technological advancements and increased funding. Despite these challenges, the potential of AR to enhance learning outcomes is clear. This research concludes that AR simulations can be a valuable educational tool, with further studies needed to explore the scalability of AR applications in various educational settings and to develop evidence-based guidelines for effective integration.","Arshad, Zuhaili Mohd Azman, Mohamed Nor Azhari Kenzhaliyev, Olzhas Kassimov, Farid R.",,"Arshad, ZM Azman, MNA Kenzhaliyev, O Kassimov, FR",706,"[Arshad, Zuhaili Mohd; Azman, Mohamed Nor Azhari] Univ Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Fac Tech & Vocat, Perak, Malaysia.

"Challenges in teaching science require innovative approaches-creating new methods and materials to improve student learning experiences. Innovations are essential for national development, fostering growth and positive change. This study focused on developing and evaluating an Innovative Laboratory Package (ILP) designed for science projects in natural product screening. It used a developmental research design and followed the ASSURE instructional model. The study identified that the least common lab tests conducted by students and teachers on natural products included basic pharmacological-toxicological, antioxidant, and cytotoxic assays of plant extracts. Access to laboratory materials and financial support presented moderate challenges for the participants. Laboratory analysts rated the ILP as outstanding, and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers highly evaluated its content, structure, coherence, learning activities, usefulness, appearance, organization, and innovativeness. Teachers reported that using the ILP provided new, meaningful, and engaging experiences, promoted critical thinking and scientific attitudes, allowed easy and flexible experiments, and equipped students with new scientific skills in a cost-effective way. The ILP could enhance science projects and develop research expertise in plant screening for both students and teachers. The findings can help curriculum developers create innovative learning resources and prioritize curriculum innovations. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by IASE.

"Socioscientific issues represent an innovative approach within the realm of STEM education as they integrate real-world problems, promote critical thinking, and encourage interdisciplinary learning, thus preparing students to address complex societal challenges through scientific inquiry. The objective of this scoping review was to analyze the use of SSIs in science lessons. A database search of Web of Science and Scopus focused on articles published between 2013 and 2023. When applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 106 articles were selected. The scoping review revealed a focus on socioscientific issues within high school and undergraduate curricula, particularly pertaining to environmental, genetic, and health-related concerns, as well as localized SSIs. A variety of methodological approaches, predominantly qualitative, were applied to capture the educational dynamics of integrating socioscientific issues into pedagogy. Inquiry-based learning emerges as a preferred pedagogical model, stimulating student engagement with real societal challenges. The educational resources employed encompass both conventional texts and digital tools, such as data mapping and visualization software, facilitating a multifaceted comprehension of SSIs. Pedagogical techniques are diverse, incorporating argumentation, role-playing, and digital media to enrich the teaching and learning experience. Nevertheless, the incorporation of socioscientific issues faces obstacles, including resistance to pedagogical innovation, the inherent complexity of the topics, and the demand for specialized teacher training.","Viehmann, Cristina Cardenas, Juan Manuel Fernandez Pena, Cristina Gehibie Reynaga",5827,"Viehmann, C Cárdenas, JMF Peña, CGR",,"[Viehmann, Cristina; Cardenas, Juan Manuel Fernandez; Pena, Cristina Gehibie Reynaga] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Humanities & Educ, Monterrey Campus, Monterrey 64700, NL, Mexico.",Tecnologico de Monterrey,,,,,2025-01-19,socioscientific issues; science education; pedagogy; civic education; scoping review; innovation in education,10.3390/su16145827,Review,,2071-1050,crismarian@gmail.com; j.m.fernandez@tec.mx; cristina.reynaga@tec.mx,,,,,ZU1K7,SOCIO-SCIENTIFIC ISSUES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP; EDUCATION; LITERACY; STUDENTS; CLASSROOM; KNOWLEDGE; INQUIRY; ARGUMENTATION,14,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,English,,122,gold,"Reynaga-Pena, Cristina G./0000-0003-3039-551X; Viehmann, Cristina/0009-0004-2716-6729; Fernandez-Cardenas, Juan Manuel/0000-0003-2044-1658","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",JUL,29,BASEL,,,J,MDPI,2024,"Reynaga-Peña, Cristina/GMX-3386-2022; Fernandez-Cardenas, Juan Manuel/D-7063-2014","Viehmann, C; Cárdenas, JMF (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Humanities & Educ, Monterrey Campus, Monterrey 64700, NL, Mexico.",Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,SUSTAINABILITY,,,2,The Use of Socioscientific Issues in Science Lessons: A Scoping Review,40,40,WOS:001277708700001,16,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),2
"Information Technology, communication, and innovation require specific, essential competencies that employers look for in engineers. Responding to this, Tecnologico de Monterrey has been implementing the Tec21 Educational model to foster students' competencies by involving them in challenge-based learning (CBL). The iWeek is one of the first implementations of this model, where students experience immersive learning for a whole week. This study presents the iWeek Innovation Challenge to improve students' innovation and information technology and communication skills through a CBL didactic technique. During this iWeek, a group of students developed efficient solutions with Microsoft Power Apps to solve real challenges confronting a global company. The results proved that students could quickly learn and apply knowledge and develop practical, innovative solutions to real problems in Industry. It was a revelation to the stakeholders to notice how fast students can become familiar with new information technology tools to propose solutions that positively impact the company. Strong partnerships between academia and industry are crucial to developing student disciplinary and transversal competencies by challenging them to solve real-life problems in real-world environments. This work presents a roadmap for planning and designing a CBL iWeek with an educational partner from Industry. It includes the implementation details, assessment instruments, and results analysis. Finally, we also highlight the significant contributions of iWeek to explain the value of this immersive experience in the teaching-learning process.","Lara-Prieto, Vianney Flores-Garza, Gilberto E.",,"Lara-Prieto, V Flores-Garza, GE",81,"[Lara-Prieto, Vianney; Flores-Garza, Gilberto E.] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Ave Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey, NL, Mexico.

"Objective: Identifying clinical markers and characteristics of the transition to menopause is an important woman's health issue, and recent long-term, prospective, cohort studies are just beginning to offer insight into methods of predicting the transition to menopause. One of the major challenges of conducting prospective cohort studies is the problem of attrition-both the retention of study participants and the influence of dropouts on the final study results. We conducted this systematic analysis to: 1) identify baseline predictors of subsequent long-term participation, and 2) determine the demographic, psychosocial, and hormonal differences between participants and dropouts among a group of premenopausal women enrolled in a longitudinal study of ovarian aging. Design: Using data from the Penn Ovarian Aging study, premenopausal women aged 35 to 47 enrolled in the study were classified as either Active (full participants), Skipped, or Dropped participants based on their visit pattern during a 4-year study interval. Results: Most of the demographic and psychosocial variables did not significantly differ between the Active, Skipped, or Dropped groups. There was no racial difference in study participation. The Dropouts were more likely to have a high school education and were less likely to report menopause symptoms compared with the Actives (P < 0.01). The Skipped group reported more anxiety (P < 0.05), and members were more likely to have less than a high school education compared with the Actives (P < 0.03). Hormone levels (estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone) at enrollment were within the premenopausal range and did not significantly differ among the three study groups. These findings remained after adjustment for covariates and hormone levels in multivariate analyses. Conclusions: Education, anxiety levels and menopause symptoms at baseline differed marginally between the women participating fully and those who dropped out or skipped multiple assessments. These findings are important and indicate that long-term study participation rates do not differ substantially by racial group or any of the other demographic or hormonal characteristics examined.","Nelson, DB Sammel, MD Freeman, EW Liu, L Langan, E Gracia, CR",,"Nelson, DB Sammel, MD Freeman, EW Liu, L Langan, E Gracia, CR",543,"Univ Penn, Hosp Univ Penn, Sch Med, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat,Dept Biostat & Epide, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.

"BackgroundEarly childhood caries is a significant oral health issue in socially deprived communities, including refugees, where prevention plays a crucial role in minimizing the challenges and costs associated with treating early childhood caries. To improve oral health outcomes, it is important to understand parents' knowledge, attitudes, and practices. This study aims to assess the oral health knowledge, practices, and attitudes of refugee parents.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 503 parents/caregivers residing in Erbil's refugee camps in Iraq, with healthy preschool children aged one to six years. Structured questionnaire was utilized in conducting individual interviews with parents to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The questionnaire collected demographic information and data on access to oral health services.ResultsA total of 503 out of 505 households actively participated in the study, resulting in a high response rate of 99.6%. Demographic analysis revealed that the majority of respondents were female parents, constituting 92.05% of the sample. Within the participant pool, the primary age groups were 26-35 years (55.3%) and 18-25 years (26.2%). Educational background analysis revealed that a significant proportion of parents had attained a secondary school education (29.6%) or primary school education (27.4%). Statistical analysis further established a noteworthy association between educational background and knowledge level. The investigation of participants' knowledge uncovered notable gaps and misconceptions pertaining to early childhood caries, with an overall mean score of 5.1. Assessing the overall attitude of parents, a mean score of 3.87 (SD = 1.29) suggested a generally unfavorable attitude towards oral hygiene practices and prevention of early childhood caries. In terms of actual practices, parents demonstrated a mean practice score of 5.7.ConclusionsThis study emphasizes knowledge gaps and misconceptions among parents in refugee camps regarding early childhood caries in preschool children. Findings revealed low knowledge scores, limited understanding of hidden sugars, delayed oral hygiene practices, and limited knowledge about fluoride.","Al-Dahan, Hamsa Mohammed Ismael, Sherzad Ali",792,"Al-Dahan, HM Ismael, SA",,"[Al-Dahan, Hamsa Mohammed] Kurdistan Board Med Specialties, Dent Publ Hlth, Runaki, Erbil, Iraq.

"The enhancing migration processes in various Russia's regions lead to a wider ethnic range of students in educational institutions. Therefore, pedagogues should know special educational technologies associated with the specifics of students' ethnic identity. All this makes the issue under study relevant. The goal of the paper is to reveal the involvement of parents of junior schoolchildren - the representatives of non-indigenous nationalities in school education and the involvement of professional educational technologies in family education. The technology of a consultative dialogue, which enables to reveal the challenges of family education and consider them in a holistic manner as well as to assist in their solution from the perspective of a current theory of education, is the leading method for studying this issue. For this purpose, the authors have created a multi-ethnic child-adult consultative center. The paper shows the problems of training and education of junior schoolchildren - representatives of non-indigenous nationalities revealed during the study. It defines the needs for arranging a consultative dialogue between pedagogues and parents of junior schoolchildren on the issues of their education, socialization, and adaptation in a Russian-speaking region. The paper defines the principles of integration of family and school education on the example of physical education. It gives the topics of consultations on the integration of family and school physical education, which are of most interest for the representatives of non-indigenous nationalities. The paper proves that the implementation of these results will enable to optimize the process of socialization and adaptation of junior schoolchildren of non-indigenous nationalities in a Russian-speaking region and will contribute to the consolidation of schoolchildren. The materials of the paper can be useful for the pedagogues at other levels of education as well as for specialists of further education system in working with multi-ethnic child groups and for social pedagogues in working with migrant families and creating conflict-free educational environment.","Grigorieva, Elena L.

"Objective: To assess the perspectives and barriers towards dengue preventive practices among the residents of Puducherry, India. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 300 households in Puducherry, using a population-proportionate (7:3) distribution from urban and rural areas by grid sampling. One adult interview per household was conducted and the participants were selected using a KISH grid. A semi-structured questionnaire based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) with additional questions on knowledge assessment was used. Knowledge was assessed based on the correctness of answers and the HBM scores were calculated on a 5-point Likert scale. Participants were categorized based on the median score under each domain. Logistic regression was used for adjusted analysis and models were built to predict the performances in each domain. Results: Four percent of the participants lacked basic knowledge regarding dengue transmission. While 208 (69.3%) participants did not consider themselves at risk of contracting dengue within the next year, majority perceived dengue as a disease with low severity. Around 49.3% (148) were skeptical about the benefit of time and money spent on dengue prevention. Inadequate government efforts were stated as the major barrier (47.0%) and frequent reminders (142, 47.3%) as the major cue to action. Age above 50 years (aOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.04-3.06, P=0.037)) and rural locality (aOR 2.68, 95% CI 1.52-4.71, P=0.001) were found to be significantly associated with poor knowledge scores. Urban participants had a significantly higher chance to perceive low susceptibility as compared to the rural counterparts (aOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.05-2.9, P=0.03). Participants with less than a high school education had low perceived benefits (aOR 2.46, 95% CI 1.52-3.96, P<0.001) and low self-efficacy scores (aOR 2.66, 95% CI 1.61-4.39, P<0.001). Conclusions: This study identifies key gaps in dengue prevention, including low perceived susceptibility, mild disease perception, limited knowledge of breeding sites, and overreliance on government efforts. Tailoring interventions to community needs, stratified to factors influencing the community perspectives can significantly improve dengue prevention efforts.","Govindasamy, Dharani Vijalakashmi, Gnanasekaran Vijayakumar, Balakrishnan Rahul, Arya",,"Govindasamy, D Vijalakashmi, G Vijayakumar, B Rahul, A",358,"[Govindasamy, Dharani; Vijalakashmi, Gnanasekaran; Vijayakumar, Balakrishnan; Rahul, Arya] Minist Hlth & Family Welf Govt India, Indian Council Med Res, Vector Control Res Ctr, Deapt Hlth Res, Pondicherry 605006, India.",Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR); ICMR - Vector Control Research Center (VCRC),,,,,2025-01-19,Dengue; Public perspectives; Prevention; Barriers; Health belief model,10.4103/apjtm.apjtm_771_23,Article,,2352-4146,aryaasp@gmail.com,368,,"Indian Council of Medical Research-Vector Control Research Centre, Puducherry","This work was supported intramurally by Student thesis funding for Masters in public Health Entomology (2022) from the Indian Council of Medical Research-Vector Control Research Centre, Puducherry.",E6O5N,FEVER; AWARENESS; BEHAVIORS; KNOWLEDGE,8,ASIAN PAC J TROP MED,Asian Pac.

"PurposeTo increase our understanding of child and parent characteristics, family functioning and main challenges in daily life in children and families in need of rehabilitation in the chronic phase of pediatric acquired brain injury (pABI).MethodsFifty-eight children (aged 6-16, 48% girls) were included at least one year post ABI. Demographics and questionnaire data regarding children's symptom burden, parents' emotional symptoms and family functioning were collected. Children and parents named their main pABI-related challenges in daily life, and these were categorized in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Descriptive statistical analyses were performed.ResultsParents' emotional symptom loads were high; 22.3% had moderate, moderate-severe or severe depression symptoms while the equivalent number for anxiety symptoms was 17.9%. Problematic family functioning was reported by 32.1% of parents. When asked about their main pABI-related challenges in daily life, 69% of children named school. The most frequent ICF chapters for children and parents were school education, energy and drive functions (mainly fatigue), and emotional functions. Codes spanned across all ICF-domains.ConclusionsRehabilitation for pABI should have a broad, interdisciplinary, and family-centered approach, with school, fatigue, and emotional functioning of parents and children as potential core elements. Rehabilitation for children with ABI in the chronic phase and their families should have a broad, interdisciplinary and biopsychosocial approach.The children's and parents' large focus on school functioning (including social aspects), emotional functioning, and fatigue in the current, heterogeneous sample indicates that these may be candidates for core elements in rehabilitation of children with acquired brain injury.The well-established focus in rehabilitation on << returning to school >> after ABI may need to be broadened to << coping with school over time >> for a subset of children.In addition to well-established factors that are important in rehabilitation and family-centered care, we suggest that caregiving burden of families and siblings' functioning should also be considered.","Rohrer-Baumgartner, Nina Holthe, Ingvil Laberg Svendsen, Edel Jannecke Dahl, Hilde M.

"Background: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer (LGBTQ+) individuals face unique health challenges when compared to the general population. Physicians can play an integral role in either addressing these health inequities or further perpetuate discrimination. Despite the growing LGBTQ+ population in the United States and exposure during clinical care, many medical schools still lack an effective, standardized LGBTQ+ healthcare curriculum. Research has shown that when medical students receive exposure to LGBTQ+ healthcare topics, it results in superior quality of care. Considering the unique challenges LGBTQ+ individuals face, coupled with the perception medical students have of the current LGBTQ+ curriculum, and the positive impact LGBTQ+ education may have on patient care, there is a need for an effective and standardized LGBTQ+ curriculum in medical school education.Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a two-hour interactive LGBTQ+ workshop at increasing confidence and comfortability in LGBTQ+ topics and healthcare education for preclinical medical students.Methods: Twenty-five first-and second-year medical students participated in an optional two-hour interactive LGBTQ+ workshop. The first hour consisted of a lecture overviewing LGBTQ+ clinical medicine from a physician specializing in LGBTQ+ topics and care. The second hour was made up of four 15-minute stations. Students were split up evenly and rotated through these four stations consisting of: (1) a one-on-one standardized patient simulation, (2) discussion-based case scenarios, (3) an interactive seminar on transgender healthcare, and (4) a debriefing station. All facilitators and standardized patients were members of the LGBTQ+ community. Consenting participants were provided with a pre-and post-survey consisting of basic demographic questions, and 16 LGBTQ+ healthcare specific statements that they answered using a 7 -point Likert scale.Results: Fifteen of the 25 (60%) preclinical medical students completed all components of both the pre-and post-survey. 53.3% of the respondents were heterosexual, while 40% identified as being a part of the LGBTQ+ community. Survey results demonstrated a significant increase compared to the pre-workshop baseline in preclinical student comfort and confidence in 12 out of the 16 LGBTQ+ healthcare specific statements after completion of the workshop.Conclusions: Our study suggests that focused education, such as through workshops, on LGBTQ+ topics can significantly increase preclinical student comfort and confidence when encountering LGBTQ+ clinical scenarios. In the future, we hope this workshop is implemented within our core medical school curriculum as a mandatory course to reach a wider audience. This workshop offers an efficient and effective model for other medical schools to implement to educate their medical students on LGBTQ+ healthcare topics.","Zajac, Kelsee K.

"This study combines heuristic and phenomenological approaches to analyze past phenomena regarding issues related to the implementation of school autonomy. A naturalistic approach regarding contemporary logical phenomena is used to see the practice of school autonomy after being returned to the provincial government. The main data sources of this study were school principals, teachers, school committee administrators, education leaders, and experts who were selected at random. The results of the study revealed that, in the early phase of regional autonomy, schools had flexible authority in managing the contribution of the provincial government; quality control through the results of the National Examination became the main requirement in determining graduation and became a source of pride for district/city governments. District/city governments compete fiercely in achieving the highest ranking through the implementation of the National Examination. This causes cheating to often become a debated issue among education observers and the public regarding the implementation of the National Examination. The research findings show that, since 2017, the issue of cheating on the National Examination is no longer a frightening specter because student graduation is no longer only determined by the National Examination.","Indra, Ristapawa Ritonga, Mahyudin Kustati, Martin Rini, Rini Zulmuqim Iswanto, Rahmat Gheisari, Asma",9887162,"Indra, R Ritonga, M Kustati, M Rini, R Zulmuqim Iswanto, R Gheisari, A",,"[Indra, Ristapawa] STKIP Pesisir Selatan, Bukittinggi, Indonesia.

"Modern education relies heavily on educational technology, which provides students with unique learning experiences and enhances their ability to learn. There has been a long history of technology being used in education, particularly computers. There is a growing trend toward incorporating technological tools and resources into early childhood education. Because of this, there is a pressing need to develop, utilise and analyse methods and re-sources specifically geared for young children. The age of AI will have a significant impact on future society. Only a very small number of theoretical or empirical investigations have been conducted on how artificial intelligence and machine learning-based influences school education. Children as young as 2-5 years old were developing AI and machine learning information and models, as well as watching, investigating, and describing their own interactions with machine learning. Following an examination of early childhood family education's challenges, an examination of the impacts and opportunities presented by today's artificial intelligence era, and a discussion of some practical applications in childhood development family education are all that remain.","Ganesh, D.

"Much has been discussed about the current teaching model and how it could be implemented. In this sense, it is imperative to review the curricular organization, time and space of classes, and the teaching methodologies adopted by teachers. According to research, the active methodologies can help the teaching practice in these challenges, because, in this way, the student is transformed into the protagonist and responsible for his learning. Therefore, the objective of this article is to make a theoretical reflection about the teaching and learning process focused on mathematics education with the use of active methodologies. For this purpose, the following specific objectives were established: to conduct a literature review in books and journals published in the last five years about active methodologies for teaching mathematics; to conceptualize such methodologies and their importance in school education; and to highlight some verified practices and successful cases of their application.

"There is a dearth of knowledge on the emotional challenges content-area teachers in English-medium instruction (EMI) programmes face, and how they manage their emotions in their efforts to negotiate a top-down language policy. This paper examines the entangled emotional experiences of EMI content-area teachers in Nepal's school education. In contrast to a psychological approach to teachers' emotions, this article draws on sociocultural and ideological perspectives on emotions to unpack a connection between emotions, institutional language policies, language ideologies, identity, and teacher agency. The analysis of EMI teachers' emotional dynamics essentially identifies their emotions as 'entanglements', reflecting the interconnectedness of emotions with other variables such as language ideology, identity, and agency in content-and-language-integrated education. The findings of this study showed that teachers' limited English proficiency led to negative emotions (e.g. anxiety, fear, frustration, and shame), stimulating them to use English-Nepali bilingualism as a creative strategy to manage their emotional challenges and also to exercise their agency in response to their students' needs. However, their translanguaging strategy - which otherwise might have included the students' home language, Bhojpuri - was restricted by hegemonic language ideologies. The findings show that multilingual teachers typically do not experience emotions in a vacuum but in response to other social phenomena. The paper supports the argument that teacher emotion management is not an apolitical process but is rather ideologically and discursively constructed and situated.","Sah, Pramod K.

"Mexico's obesity rates are alarming, and experts project drastic increases in the next thirty years. There is growing interest in understanding how remote acculturation and globalization processes influence health behaviors. The present study used focus group data from a central state, San Luis Potosi, in Mexico to explore mothers' perspectives on factors that influence family mealtime routines. Thematic analysis was used to identify barriers and facilitators to healthy mealtime routines and diet within families. Twenty-one mothers participated in the focus groups; 76% were full-time stay at home mothers, the majority were low-income (65%), and fewer than half reached a high school education. Three major themes emerged: (1) mothers do most of the visible work involving mealtime routines; (2) family meals are different today, and globalization is a contributing factor; and (3) family mealtimes are shifting to weekend events. Empowering mothers to negotiate diet with family members to build healthy routines, navigate challenges due to changing environments, and set family boundaries around technology use during mealtimes should be taken into consideration when promoting healthy behaviors with Mexican families.","Villegas, Elizabeth Hammons, Amber J.

"International comparative studies on mathematics teaching and learning often provide unitary and harmonious images of classroom practices. This paper aims to complement those studies by describing the complex aspects of those practices. Adopting activity theory as a framework, this paper considers classroom teaching and learning of mathematics as an activity system embedded in socio-historical contexts, analyzes its contradictions, and makes a comparative analysis of different practices of mathematics teaching and learning in the same country. As a case in point, mathematics lessons in Japanese secondary schools are considered. The initial activity system of mathematics lessons in Japanese modern schools came from the whole-class instruction system and then gradually evolved into the problem-solving style lesson. The latter has been facing challenges, and then a new activity system has emerged from a new paradigm of school education. It is argued that activity systems analysis enables us to understand the contradictions prevailing in mathematics education and that comparative analysis of more than one system in the same culture can provide valuable insights.","Sekiguchi, Yasuhiro",,"Sekiguchi, Y",493,"[Sekiguchi, Yasuhiro] Yamaguchi Univ, Fac Educ, 1677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi 7538513, Japan.",Yamaguchi University,,,,,2025-01-19,Problem-solving; School as learning community; Activity theory; Activity systems; Japanese education,10.1007/s10649-021-10069-6,Article,JUN 2021,1573-0816,ysekigch@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp,511,,"JSPS KAKENHI [JP26590237, JP19K02785]","A previous version of this paper was presented at Topic Study Group 51 of 13th International Congress on Mathematical Education, Hamburg, 24-31 July 2016.

"Settler-colonial futurity and colonial onto-epistemology are embedded across mainstream Australian public education institutions and schooling. While Country is central to Indigenous being, knowledges and pedagogy, Australian public and school education and curricula regularly fail to engage with Country and place in its historical, political, institutional, more-than-human, and relational dimensions. This paper investigates how colonial discourse and narratives permeate public and schooling education resources about mining and the Australian gold rush, including those presented in local Victorian gold rush museums. These support an influential story of Australia's past/present that erases First Nations 1 custodial relations with Country, strengthens settler-colonial futurity and celebrates and legitimises its colonising and extractive relations between people, Country, and ecologies. The paper presents an argument for attending to critical, relational geopolitics in education and environmental education to destabilise and shift these ways of understanding. It considers opportunities and challenges presented by Australian curricula in terms of their capacity to develop geopolitical understandings of past/present/future social and ecological in/justice, and to support new political understandings and sense of connection and belonging with Country.","Bellingham, Robin A.

"Objective The purpose of this review is to identify the impact of virtual reality (VR) technology on student engagement, specifically cognitive engagement, behavioral engagement, and affective engagement.Methods A comprehensive search of databases such as Google, Scopus, and Elsevier was conducted to identify English-language articles related to VR and classroom engagement for the period from 2014 to 2023. After systematic screening, 33 articles were finally reviewed.Results The use of VR in the classroom is expected to improve student engagement and learning outcomes, and is particularly effective for students with learning disabilities. However, introducing VR into middle school education poses several challenges, including difficulties in the education system to keep up with VR developments, increased demands on students' digital literacy, and insufficient proficiency of teachers in using VR.Conclusion To effectively utilize VR to increase student engagement, we advocate for educational policymakers to provide training and technical support to teachers to ensure that they can fully master and integrate VR to increase student engagement and instructional effectiveness.","Lin, Xiao Ping Li, Bin Bin Yao, Zhen Ning Yang, Zhi Zhang, Mingshu",1360574,"Lin, XP Li, BB Yao, ZN Yang, Z Zhang, MS",,"[Lin, Xiao Ping] Silpakorn Univ, Fac Educ, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.

"This work intends to support a reflection on didactics as a disciplinary field from the identification of new theoretical and practical references. Didactics has been constituted primarily around the study and intervention in school education. This discipline evidences a review of the pedagogical-didactic assumptions that characterized it in its modern constitution, even when the mass education systems have presented enabling conditions for the achievement of its educational purposes. Alternative experiences to the hegemonic device present challenges to didactics that are proposed by the study and intervention in teaching practices. Likewise, other theoretical references are required to accompany the epistemological re-signification of the disciplinary field. To achieve these purposes, we analyze the training experience in the subject Didactics of the course of Teachers and Bachelor on Edu-cational Sciences, Facultad de Humanidades y Ciencias de la Educacion de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata (FaHCE-UNLP), which since 2017 has been dedicated to the problematization of this reconfiguration of didactics. In turn, the deepening of these discussions is proposed as a result of the pandemic caused by COVID-19, which has imposed new theoretical, practical, epistemological and political reflections.","Picco, Sofia",,"Picco, S",95,"[Picco, Sofia] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Humanidades & Ciencias Educ, La Plata, Argentina.",National University of La Plata,,,,,2025-01-19,cdidactic theoretical-practical field teaching metateorical review alternative experiences,10.29156/INTER.9.2.11,Article,,2301-0126,sofiapicco@fahce.unlp.edu.ar,103,,,,9B6VQ,,2,INTERCAMBIOS,InterCambios,English,,36,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,"JOSE ENRIQUE RODO 1854, MONTEVIDEO, 00000, URUGUAY",,10,MONTEVIDEO,,,J,"UNIV REPUBLICA, COMISION SECTORIAL ENSENANZA",2022,,"Picco, S (corresponding author), Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Humanidades & Ciencias Educ, La Plata, Argentina.",Education & Educational Research,,2301-0118,INTERCAMBIOS-DILEMAS Y TRANSICIONES DE LA EDUCACION SUPERIOR,,,0,New theoretical and practical references to think about didactics,0,0,WOS:000934873700012,9,,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),0
"In the Mediterranean region, floods are the main natural risk. This hazard has been aggravated in recent decades by the increase in exposure of the human being and is expected to increase the danger according to the forecast of climate change scenarios. For this reason, dealing with these issues in the classroom and the training of teachers on this subject should be a priority, as established in the curriculum of Primary Education (Social Sciences). The objectives of this research are: 1) To analyze the knowledge that future teachers have about the risk of flooding to develop these contents in the classroom; 2) Check the relevance that they give to this social-environmental problem; and 3) Analyze how they have been trained to face these challenges of teaching in Primary Education. Methodological surveys have been conducted as a case study to future teachers of Primary Education (Faculty of Teaching, University of Valencia). The results indicate that future teachers have: 1) Scarce prior knowledge in relation to flood risks; 2) A reduced perception of the importance of the vulnerability factor to mitigate the risk; and 3) Little information received about this subject in its continuous school education stage.","Morote Seguido, Alvaro Francisco Souto Gonzalez, Xose Manuel",e036,"Seguido, AFM González, XMS",,"[Morote Seguido, Alvaro Francisco; Souto Gonzalez, Xose Manuel] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",University of Valencia,,,,,2025-01-19,Education; risk; flood; instruction; Primary Education; Geography,10.3989/estgeogr.202051.031,Article,,1988-8546,alvaro.morote@uv.es; Xose.Manuel.Souto@uv.es,,,,,PZ8GR,NATURAL HAZARDS,288,ESTUD GEOGR,Estud.

"An emerging theme that has gained traction across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classrooms in recent decades is acknowledging who is responsible for the discoveries and content that we teach. Centering the human aspect of who the researchers are and how their identities intersect with perspectives in research impacts the lens through which the work is done but also shapes the community of practice in our classrooms and the evolving ecosystem of research communities that contribute to STEM education. In particular, discipline-based education research (DBER) is an emerging interdisciplinary field aimed at understanding and improving discipline-specific learning and teaching. Entering and establishing oneself in a new research field can be a daunting process. For many DBER scholars who began their careers in another discipline, their career trajectories have necessitated this challenge. Here, we focus on our experiences in Biology Education Research (BER). We use duoethnography to explore our overlapping trajectories into and engagements with BER, allowing for the juxtaposition of our experiences to give meanings to and build new understandings of our pathways in BER, which include entry points, reasons for persistence, and identity navigation. Through collaborative reflections, we formulated novel insights that we experienced BER as a community of practice that values the participation of emerging scholars and arrived at a transformed understanding that our educator identities were important driving factors for our continuing pursuit of BER. Results from this duoethnography not only provide insights into how BER faculty may navigate multiple professional identities but can also shed light on potential opportunities and challenges for research and practice partnerships connecting science and education faculty where such identities reside not in single individuals but with multiple persons in a cross-disciplinary collaboration. We see parallels between this work considering faculty identity and pathways into BER with work considering student identity and pathways into STEM, and we hope that these results also highlight the value of utilizing qualitative methodologies that may be novel to both the BER and more broadly, DBER, communities as a tool for centering the human experience that can spark future work and applications within STEM education.","Sung, Rou-Jia Holt, Emily A.

"In this paper, we focus on migrant parents' decision to either bring children to the cities (family reunification) or leave them behind in China. We develop a framework to understand this decision, which takes into account child characteristics, characteristics of migrant parents and characteristics of migrant-receiving communities. Our research design allows us to conduct comparison of rural-origin children and urban-origin children. The rural-urban differences are reflected in lowered probability of bringing children to cities, more hurdles for housing and access to public school education for rural migrant parents and their children. For rural-origin school-age children, gender inequality is persistent, that is, girls of school age are less likely to be brought to cities than boys. Finally, a piece of promising news is that migrant parents with more social interactions with local residents are more likely to bring children to destinations. The results suggest that years after China's official policy of 'no extra fees' for migrant children in urban public schools, migrant children, especially from rural areas, continue to face a variety of challenges in moving to cities and having access to local urban public schools.","Liang, Zai Li, Yuanfei Yue, Zhongshan",,"Liang, Z Li, YF Yue, ZS",,"[Liang, Zai] SUNY Albany, Dept Sociol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

"Considering the fact that leisure time has become an increasingly interesting theme-problem in Social Sciences, we link its theoretical-conceptual, methodological and empirical developments to the opportunities offered by intergenerational bonds for the construction of a more inclusive and equitable society, from and for all ages. With the explicit will of incorporating leisure to the learnings sought after in daily life, the importance of the experiences that fuel intergenerational programs in different contexts and realities shall be emphasized. Opting for a study of cases, several initiatives protagonized by students and teachers from various Primary and Secondary schools with the elderly, many of them in a dependence situation, have been identified, described and analized. Recognized as good practices -having been awarded by the DomusVi Foundation between 2016 and 2020- they highlight the pedagogical and social potential of leisure time in intergenerational relationships, both from an individual and a collective perspective. Improving their theoretical basis, providing them with institutional and professional resources or boosting their processes are just some of the challenges raised to guarantee their continuity and sustainability over time, improving ourselves as people and as a society.","Gradaille, Rita Antonio Caride, Jose Belen Caballo, M.",,"Gradaílle, R Caride, JA Caballo, MB",27,"[Gradaille, Rita; Antonio Caride, Jose; Belen Caballo, M.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,,,,,2025-01-19,intergenerational programmes; leisure; school education; social education; old people,10.25115/psye.v13i3.5078,Article,,1989-709X,rita.gradaille@usc.es,38,,,,ZB2NY,PROGRAMS,3,PSYCHOL SOC EDUC,Psychol.

"Studies about international migrant students in primary school are increasingly frequent in the educational literature. There is a strengthening on the production of international scholarship that seek to guide the debate on international migration policies and the defense of the right to education as a fundamental human right regardless of status, citizenship, or the existence of official identity documents, a right guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of the Rights of the Child. International migration processes are multiple and heterogeneous. The origins of migration are plural, as are the forms of reception in the countries of destination or transit. In the field of educational policy, researches observe that international migrant students may go through totally different schooling processes, with very different reception and permanence policies, depending on the school, education network or country in which they are. In this heterogeneous and complex international context, we present this dossier with the aim of contributing to an expanded reflection on the educational policies compared to international migrant populations in different countries, guaranteeing a multiplicity of voices, theoretical perspectives and fields of study.","Bruel, Ana Lorena Rigoni, Isabelle Armagnague, Maitena",,"Bruel, AL Rigoni, I Armagnague, M",,"[Bruel, Ana Lorena] Univ Fed Parana UFPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.

"In alignment with the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDG s), nuclear science and technology (NST) significantly contributes to nine out of seventeen SDG s. As an integral component of nuclear human resource development (HRD), it is imperative to introduce young students to NST through effective STEAM or STEM methodologies. However, Thailand's progress in NST literacy and public awareness has been suboptimal, despite over five decades of nuclear HRD initiatives. While various nuclear-related organizations have undertaken numerous activities, their lack of coordination and comprehensiveness poses challenges for sustainable development. To address this, concerted efforts must involve collaboration with schoolteachers to inte-- grate NST into the national science curriculum and syllabus. This entails a review and revision process aimed at incorporating more hands-on experiments to ignite students' curiosity and enthusiasm for NST. Through strategic planning and implementation, Thai students will develop a deeper familiarity with NST, thereby enhancing their overall NST literacy and contributing to the nation's sustainable development goals.","Saengkaew, Phannee Chanyotha, Supitcha Pengvanich, Phongphaeth Srijaroen, Benjawan Phruksarojanakun, Phiphat Cherdchu, Chainarong Takaki, Rieko Iimoto, Takeshi",,"Saengkaew, P Chanyotha, S Pengvanich, P Srijaroen, B Phruksarojanakun, P Cherdchu, C Takaki, R Iimoto, T",32,"[Saengkaew, Phannee; Chanyotha, Supitcha; Pengvanich, Phongphaeth] Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Nucl Engn, Bangkok, Thailand.

"Introduction: the population demands a healthy gastronomy (binomial Gastronomy and Nutrition), so it must include knowledge of food and health. Health, Education and Gastronomy complement each other. The institutional food service must be healthy and at the same time pleasant. Objectives: collect activities, resources and interventions that have been carried out in various institutional food services (school lunches, nursing homes and hospitals) where knowledge about gastronomy and healthy eating has been included as a teaching method at different levels. Methods: a review of the actions and/or materials developed to educate on healthy gastronomy from different areas of collective catering has been carried out, as well as the search for scientific articles in the PubMed, Dialnet and Google academic databases. Results: the Taste Workshops are complementary and useful educational material for the teachers of Infant and Primary School Education. The menus of nursing home must have a good nutritional contribution and organoleptic quality that stimulates the well-being and socialization of the users, considering that in old age sensory losses affects the pleasure of eating. The alimentary model in the hospital is adapted mainly to the health needs of the users and must reach a gastronomic suitability that will produce well-being during the stay. Conclusions: institutional food service poses challenges in food preparation and conservation, quality and food safety, nutritional value of food and its implications for the health of populations, and from the point of view of gastronomy, since it involves a daily routine in groups of vulnerable population such as schoolchildren, hospitalized people or the elderly.","Valero Gaspar, Teresa Avila Torres, Jose Manuel Varela-Moreiras, Gregorio",,"Gaspar, TV Torres, JMA Varela-Moreiras, G",56,"[Valero Gaspar, Teresa; Avila Torres, Jose Manuel; Varela-Moreiras, Gregorio] Fdn Espanola Nutr, C Gen Alvarez de Castro 20,1a Planta, Madrid, Spain.

"The objective of the presented study was to explore the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sustainability of school education by comparing Polish and German experiences in coping with the problems caused by the switch to emergency remote learning based on the school principals' opinions. A qualitative approach was used for data collection and analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 principals (13 from Poland and 13 from Germany). Thematic analysis was used to categorize the findings and to create themes and subthemes. The findings revealed that principals of both countries demonstrated clear positions for sustainable school functioning and proved their leadership competences to face the challenges of remote teaching during the pandemic. However, most of the participants reported issues regarding the organization and maintenance of sustainable e-learning, effective ICT integration and technological support. Both Polish and German school principals asserted, despite the lack of major institutional support, that their teaching staff managed to adapt quickly to the complex crisis conditions to mitigate the negative consequences of the COVID-19 on education.","Demeshkant, Nataliia Schultheis, Klaudia Hiebl, Petra",,"Demeshkant, N Schultheis, K Hiebl, P",120,"[Demeshkant, Nataliia] Pedag Univ Krakow, Inst Educ Sci, Krakow, Poland.

"The prerequisites for this research included the rapid development and constant modernization of massive open online courses (MOOCs) and their dissemination in higher education, in particular, in the preparation of medical practitioners of various specialties. The present investigation was conducted among two groups of students of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (experimental and control, 48 and 46 people respectively). For the control group, a standard MOOC with a training design characteristic of the vast majority of similar courses was proposed. The experimental group took the MOOC with additional learning strategies. Results showed the introduction of collaborative learning and decision-making assignments in e-education could overcome the challenges of MOOCs or at least significantly reduce their negative impact on the learning process. The share of experimental group participants who completed the training course and passed all the tests was 78.26%, while in the control group, their part was only 39.58%. The study findings can be widely applied when designing new MOOC curricula or improving the existing courses.","Berestova, Anna Kondratenko, Larisa Lobuteva, Liudmila Lobuteva, Alisa Berechikidze, Iza",,"Berestova, A Kondratenko, L Lobuteva, L Lobuteva, A Berechikidze, I",4,"[Berestova, Anna] IM Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Sechenov Univ, Dept Pathol Anat, Moscow, Russia.

"The current pandemic and social isolation scenario challenges educators to reinvent pedagogical ways of acting that enhance the child's harmonious development, using the development of their critical thinking. In this process, recognizing the pedagogical potential of digital technologies and resources and the need to create networked learning environments, involving children and their families, the kindergarten teacher and the surrounding society, this article aims to describe and reflect on the pedagogical implications inherent to the creation and dynamization of an experience lived with children of three and four years, in pre-school education, showing the critical thinking skills to be developed. This study assumes investigative characteristics that reflect on the educator's pedagogical action, bearing in mind that it is intended to report the options taken to enhance the development of critical thinking skills through the use of diversified digital resources. The study inserted in a qualitative paradigm demonstrated the relevance of reflective educational action based on an informed selection process and the construction of educational resources that enhance the development of the child's critical thinking, through the pedagogical exploration of resources available in the digital sphere.","Mesquita, Nidia Martins, Diana Gamboa, Maria Jose",,"Mesquita, N Martins, D Gamboa, MJ",101,"[Mesquita, Nidia; Martins, Diana] Escola Super Educ & Ciencias Socials, Leiria, Portugal.

"As an emerging invasive species, the black mussel Mytella strigata has been recognized for its adverse ecological impacts, such as biofouling and negative effects on shellfish aquaculture. This study examined perceptions and responses from eight key stakeholder groups directly affected by M. strigata in Panguil Bay, Philippines. We also quantified its effects on human well-being (safety, material goods, social practices, health) and ecosystem services (biodiversity, aesthetics, water quality, livelihood, and food sources). Affected stakeholders were primarily young to middle-aged married adults with at least a high school education, living in households of 4 to 6 members. They identified various impacts of M. strigata, including biofouling and financial setbacks, as well as benefits like additional food sources and increased income. Responses ranged from manual removal to exploring alternative livelihoods. Stakeholders acknowledged significant negative effects on human well-being and ecosystem services, reflecting shifts in priorities based on direct interactions with bay resources. The limited use of M. strigata as food, aquaculture feed, and bait was noted, with varying local preferences regarding consumption and sale. Stakeholders recommended livelihood training, removal/control initiatives, market development, awareness campaigns, and policy support to address M. strigata challenges. These findings highlight the need for management strategies that balance ecological sustainability with economic stability. The community's adaptive resource use, proactive strategies, and participatory governance provide a robust framework for addressing the challenges posed by M. strigata.","Uba, Kaent Immanuel N.

"Thinking about teaching knowledge has been relevant in a society marked by changes that follow the live and dynamic flow of school education. With each new experience, the individuals actively respond to what is imposed on them and, for this reason, build spaces for the production of knowledge. Given this, and taking into account the challenges encountered for the development of teaching practices in emergency remote teaching by Portuguese language teachers in initial training, the objective of this work is to study the active responsiveness of undergraduates in Languages/Portuguese in the construction of their teaching knowledge in the supervised internship period in emergency remote education. From a qualitative research approach, within the perspective of Applied Linguistics, responsive and responsible area, the discourses analyzed reveal three focuses through which the responsive movements of, three undergraduates who collaborated with the research permeate, such as: teaching knowledge and active responses with a focus on the formation of the teacher and teaching methodologies, teaching knowledge and active responses focusing on the student and teaching knowledge and active responses focusing on performance and professional conditions.","da Silva Junior, Silvio Nunes Karlo-Gomes, Geam",e02129,"da Silva, SN Karlo-Gomes, G",,"[da Silva Junior, Silvio Nunes] Univ Fed Alagoas, Secretaria Municipal Educ Palmeira Indios AL, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil.

"This article describes a research project that aimed to classify different types of sustainability-related school tasks in terms of two central approaches in primary school education: action-based and task-based learning. Using a textbook analysis approach, the article clarifies implicit and explicit forms of sustainability education in school tasks in Luxembourgish science textbooks for Grades 1-6. The study uses a two-step analysis: first, scanning textbooks on content relating to sustainability; and, second, evaluating the teaching practices associated with this content apparent in the textbooks. Step one identifies the school tasks in which sustainability content is implicitly or explicitly addressed while step two analyzes which forms of action-based and task-based learning occur in these sustainability-related school tasks. Based on the results two claims can be made: first, that there is very little sustainability-related content in Luxembourgish primary science textbooks, and those topics raised mostly relate to sustainability only indirectly; secondly, action-based and task-based learning are undervalued in the context of sustainability-related school tasks; neither of the two was commonly found in school tasks in sustainability education.","Andersen, Katja N.",,"Andersen, KN",1301,"[Andersen, Katja N.] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Language & Literature, Humanities Arts & Educ, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",University of Luxembourg,,,,,2025-01-19,Science; learning; environmental education; primary school,10.1080/13504622.2017.1384798,Article,,1469-5871,Katja.andersen@uni.lu,1319,,,,HA8UA,CHALLENGES; MIDDLE,9,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

"The recent development of making secondary school education free in Ghana has raised concerns about the level of preparedness of teachers to teach students with diverse needs in one classroom. Significantly, mathematics is one of the core areas that the Ghanaian government has prioritised, and it has institutionalised mechanisms to encourage participation by many students. Accordingly, this qualitative study aimed to document the level of preparedness of mathematics teachers to support the teaching of students with Down syndrome in secondary school classrooms. Twenty-seven mathematics teachers from 14 schools, made up of 18 males and nine females, took part in the study. We found that participants were in favour of implementation of inclusive education. However, regarding the prospect of teaching students with Down syndrome, most of the participants thought that the regular secondary school classroom is not a suitable environment for these students to access education, especially due to a number of challenges. The need for the government to support schools with appropriate teaching materials and facilities is discussed extensively.","Opoku, Maxwell Peprah Tawiah, Richard Agyei-Okyere, Elvis Osman, Shaibu Afriyie, Sally Adwoa",,"Opoku, MP Tawiah, R Agyei-Okyere, E Osman, S Afriyie, SA",218,"[Opoku, Maxwell Peprah; Afriyie, Sally Adwoa] Univ Tasmania, Sch Educ, Launceston, Tas, Australia.

"Microfluidic devices allow for the manipulation of fluids, particles, cells, micro-sized organs or organisms in channels ranging from the nano to submillimeter scales. A rapid increase in the use of this technology in the biological sciences has prompted a need for methods that are accessible to a wide range of research groups. Current fabrication standards, such as PDMS bonding, require expensive and time consuming lithographic and bonding techniques. A viable alternative is the use of equipment and materials that are easily affordable, require minimal expertise and allow for the rapid iteration of designs. In this work we describe a protocol for designing and producing PET-laminates (PETLs), microfluidic devices that are inexpensive, easy to fabricate, and consume significantly less time to generate than other approaches to microfluidics technology. They consist of thermally bonded film sheets, in which channels and other features are defined using a craft cutter. PETLs solve field-specific technical challenges while dramatically reducing obstacles to adoption. This approach facilitates the accessibility of microfluidics devices in both research and educational settings, providing a reliable platform for new methods of inquiry.","Levis, Megan Ontiveros, Fernando Juan, Jonathan Kavanagh, Anthony Zartman, Jeremiah J.",e60307,"Levis, M Ontiveros, F Juan, J Kavanagh, A Zartman, JJ",,"[Levis, Megan; Juan, Jonathan; Kavanagh, Anthony; Zartman, Jeremiah J.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.

"This paper is the second in a five-part series on the clinical and translational science educational pipeline. It focuses on the role that Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) programs can play in supporting science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education in primary and secondary schools, as well as in facilitating these interests during transition to undergraduate training. Special emphasis should be placed on helping to form and sustain an identity as a scientist, and on instilling the persistence necessary to overcome numerous barriers to its actualization. CTSAs can contribute to cementing this sense of self by facilitating peer support, mentorship, and family involvement that will reinforce early educational decisions leading to clinical and translational science research careers. Meanwhile, the interests, skills, and motivation induced by participation in STEM programs must be sustained in transition to the next level in the educational pipeline, typically undergraduate study. Examples of CTSA collaborations with local schools, businesses, interest groups, and communities at large illustrate the emerging possibilities and promising directions with respect to each of these challenges.","Manson, Spero M.

"Scientists are shaped by their unique life experiences and bring these perspectives to their research. Diversity in life and cultural experiences among scientists, therefore, broadens research directions and, ultimately, scientific discoveries. Deaf individuals, for example, have successfully contributed their unique perspectives to scientific inquiry. However, deaf individuals still face challenges in university science education. Most deaf students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines interact with faculty who have little to no experience working with deaf individuals and who often have preconceptions or simply a lack of knowledge about deaf individuals. In addition to a lack of communication access, deaf students may also feet unwelcome in STEM, as do other underrepresented groups. In this essay, we review evidence from the literature and, where data are lacking, contribute the expert opinions of the authors, most of whom are deaf scientists themselves, to identify strategies to best support deaf students in university STEM education. We describe the journey of a hypothetical deaf student and methods for faculty to create a welcoming environment. We describe and provide recommendations for classroom seating and layout, accommodations, teaching strategies, and research mentoring. We also discuss the importance of including deaf scientists in research about deaf individuals.","Braun, Derek C. Clark, M. Diane Marchut, Amber E. Solomon, Caroline M.

"Society faces emerging challenges that require re-envisioning what it means to know and use science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and who are STEM scientists. We advocate for a transdisciplinary framework for participatory STEM learning based on the culmination of the authors' designing and complemented by reviews of extant works in youth STEM learning and engagement. Data literacy, geospatial reasoning, and community science are cornerstones in our framework because of their power to leverage and integrate the four STEM disciplines. Youth with their families are authors and designers in community problem-solving using data literacy and geospatial reasoning through participatory community science to question, analyze, and design solutions empowered by their lived experiences. Through partnerships with community organizations, families, youth, andSTEMpractitioners, we discuss howto develop and use tools and methods to design and build better spaces for youths' communities. Our aim is for more authentic, inclusive, and empowering learning opportunities that broaden youths' STEM participation. We describe our framework and the underlying commitments, design principles, expected outcomes, and limitations.","Elliott, Rebekah Loh, Carolyn G. Psenka, Carolyn E. Lewis, Jennifer M.

"Ghana has recently renewed its commitment to build a strong Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) base for improved socio-economic development. This commitment hinges on recognizing that the strength of the nation's STI policy depends on the quality of pre-tertiary education and training in science and mathematics to produce a critical mass of young people well-prepared for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses at the tertiary level. However, despite numerous interventions to improve upon STI, Ghana still performs poorly, along with other Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) countries with common STI indicators in the Global Innovation Index. Using Ghana as a lens, this article highlights the challenges in STEM teaching and learning throughout the sub-region. The qualitative research approach was adopted to allow an in-depth exploration of participants' perspectives. Six pre-tertiary schools (three Junior High Schools and three Senior High Schools) and the University of Ghana, Legon, were selected due to the availability of their students and teachers to participate in the interviews in Accra, the capital city. This article argues that, to develop the critical mass of human capital needed for sustainable development, there is a need to improve the performance of students in STEM subjects at the pre-tertiary level. In addition, performance improvement, which is linked to student interest in the study of STEM subjects, should increase the quality of students entering tertiary education institutions. These students will then be trained to meet the quality of human resources needed to run the STI system-a step toward achieving sustainable development this article recommends the redesign of STEM curriculum at the pre-tertiary level to align with tertiary STEM education as that in turn aligns with Ghana's STI system.","Akon-Yamga, Gordon Funkor, Godfried Tsey, Komla Kingsford-Adaboh, Robert Quaye, Wilhemina Ntewusu, Diana Amoni",1288413,"Akon-Yamga, G Funkor, G Tsey, K Kingsford-Adaboh, R Quaye, W Ntewusu, DA",,"[Akon-Yamga, Gordon; Quaye, Wilhemina; Ntewusu, Diana Amoni] CSIR, Sci & Technol Policy Res Inst STEPRI, Accra, Ghana.

"Augmented reality (AR) technology is increasingly utilized in cognitive development and education of preschoolers. The Augmented Reality Integrated STEM Preschooler (ARISP) module combines AR technology with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) in teaching and learning activity. This study aims to assess the impacts of the ARISP module for teaching and learning activity on children from preschool teachers' perspectives. The research methodology includes semi-structured interviews with preschool teachers and observation implementing the ARISP module for teaching and learning activity. The study examines children's interaction with AR technology, their response to the immersive learning environment, and the development of skills crucial for digital literacy. Findings indicate that the ARISP module significantly increases children's engagement and motivation in learning activities. The interactive nature of AR technology fosters a deeper understanding of STEM concepts and enhances problem-solving skills. The ARISP module demonstrates substantial promise in enriching early childhood education by integrating cutting-edge technology with traditional learning approaches.","Wang, Xinyi Rahman, Mohd Nazri Bin Abdul Shaharom, Mohd Shahril Nizam",2343527,"Wang, XY Rahman, MNB Shaharom, MSN",,"[Wang, Xinyi; Rahman, Mohd Nazri Bin Abdul; Shaharom, Mohd Shahril Nizam] Univ Malaya, Fac Educ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",Universiti Malaya,,,,,2025-01-19,"Preschool STEM education; augmented reality technology; teaching and learning activity; preschool teacher's perspective; children's development; Constantinos, Primary and Secondary Teacher Education, Xenofontos Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway; Technology; Early Childhood; Curriculum Studies; Early Years",10.1080/2331186X.2024.2343527,Article,,,mohdnazri_ar@um.edu.my,,,,,QK8S0,EDUCATION; CHALLENGES,1,COGENT EDUC,Cogent Educ.,English,,65,gold,"Wang, Xinyi/0009-0008-4477-6130","KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",DEC 31,13,OSLO,,,J,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,2024,"SHAHAROM, MOHD/B-9125-2010; Rahman, Mohd/Q-5017-2016; Wang, Xinyi/IAM-0594-2023","Rahman, MNB (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Educ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",Education & Educational Research,,2331-186X,COGENT EDUCATION,,,1,The impacts of augmented reality technology integrated STEM preschooler module for teaching and learning activity on children in China,21,26,WOS:001220864500001,11,,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),1
"The rapid development of AI in the recent years has triggered numerous discussions in the education sector since it offers numerous opportunities, but also challenges. This study addresses one context in which AI might become a relevant tool for different purposes: German secondary education. This study therefore examines the extent to which STEM teachers in German secondary education assess the benefits but also the risks of ChatGPT and how this influences the future use of AI in an educational context. As part of a questionnaire study, 102 STEM teachers were investigated. The current and future use of ChatGPT and various teacher variables were recorded with questionnaires based on classifications of researchers as well as political institutions. Relationships between the variables were explored using a path model investigating hypotheses regarding the affect heuristic, perceived risks and benefits as well as effects on teaching quality. In general, AI is still used relatively rarely, but future usage expectations are high compared to current usage. Results further revealed that perceived competence and benefits of ChatGPT have a positive influence on the use and intention to use it. Perceived risks and concerns have no significant influence on the usefulness of ChatGPT in the classroom, indicating that STEM teachers use AI in the classroom despite potential concerns and perceived risks. Additionally, perceived benefits and risks are negatively associated with each other, indicating that teachers rely on an affect heuristic when judging the usefulness of AI technology in the classroom.","Beege, Maik Hug, Christopher Nerb, Josef",100494,"Beege, M Hug, C Nerb, J",,"[Beege, Maik; Hug, Christopher; Nerb, Josef] Univ Educ Freiburg, Dept Psychol, Freiburg, Germany.",University of Freiburg; Freiburg University of Education,,,,,2025-01-19,Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; AI in education; Opportunities; Challenges,10.1016/j.chbr.2024.100494,Article,OCT 2024,,maik.beege@ph-freiburg.de,,,,,I3Z5B,ACCEPTANCE; RISKS,,COMPUT HUM BEHAV REP,Comput.

"This study examines the effectiveness of online and face-to-face (F2F) instructional methods in Capstone Senior Design (CSD) projects within Electrical Engineering (EE) and Mechanical Engineering (ME). It explores how each mode influences student success and learning outcomes, addressing the need for adaptable teaching strategies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. A comprehensive assessment was conducted, which included project evaluations, advisor feedback, and self-peer reviews. This multifaceted approach aimed to gauge the relative efficacy of online versus F2F modalities in supporting educational outcomes. The findings indicated that both online and F2F modalities achieved parity on several metrics. However, F2F settings significantly enhanced teamwork and collaboration among students. In contrast, online environments excelled in advisor evaluations, suggesting effective mentorship despite less consistent teamwork and project execution. The results emphasize the potential benefits of integrating online and traditional pedagogies to improve educational strategies and student learning experiences. The study highlights the importance of developing online instructional strategies that better mimic the collaborative advantages of F2F instruction. It also underscores the need for a holistic approach to curriculum development to prepare STEM students effectively for future challenges.","Znidi, Faycal Uddin, Md.

"Skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are increasingly in demand. Theoretical knowledge and formulas alone are frequently not sufficient to understand complex phenomena. Simulations are a valuable tool to support the conceptual understanding by visualizing invisible processes. The constant interaction with the learning material is an essential factor when learning with simulations and virtual worlds. Virtual reality (VR) technologies enable interaction with the virtual environment with a high intensity of immersion. Maroon is a VR platform for teaching physics and has been in development for over five years. Previous results with Maroon have already demonstrated the potential of virtual reality for learners and teachers, but also highlighted a list of potential challenges in terms of VR experience design, usability, and pedagogical concepts. Over the past six months, we have conducted user studies with a total of 85 participants, both student teachers (n = 26) and pupils (n = 59) at high schools and teacher training institutions. In this paper, we want to facilitate the difficult task of designing educational VR platforms by describing the expectations of educators and pupils.","Holly, Michael Pirker, Johanna Resch, Sebastian Brettschuh, Sandra Guetl, Christian",,"Holly, M Pirker, J Resch, S Brettschuh, S Gütl, C",107,"[Holly, Michael; Pirker, Johanna; Resch, Sebastian; Brettschuh, Sandra; Guetl, Christian] Graz Univ Technol, Graz, Austria.",Graz University of Technology,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; Virtual Reality; Interactive simulations; Immersive learning,,Article,,1436-4522,michael.holly@tugraz.at; johanna.pirker@tugraz.at; sebastian.resch@tugraz.at; sandra.brettschuh@tugraz.at; c.guetl@tugraz.at,119,,"Ministry of Education, Science and Research of Austria","At this point, we would like to thank all participants of this study and all those people who are and were involved in the development process.

"Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects have historically struggled to be inclusive and accessible to students from diverse backgrounds. The field of geoscience, in particular, has also had challenges in diversity with respect to staff and student recruitment. The consequence of non-inclusive practices still propagates today, with certain demographics not engaging in STEM activities. As a result, there needs to be conscious efforts to adopt equity, diversity, and inclusive (EDI) initiatives for subjects such as geoscience to grow. In this article, we outline the steps we have taken to break down known (and unknown) barriers to education in the teaching of a science outreach course to a diverse student body. Our outreach course, Think Like A Scientist, has been running in a number of English prisons since 2019. Although the programme is tailored to the restrictive prison environment, the application of its core principles to education are fundamental EDI practices that could be beneficial to a wide audience. In this paper, we outline our reasoning for specific pedagogical choices in the classroom when working with students that have low confidence in STEM education, and we highlight the need for engagement that is not only relatable, accessible, and inclusive but also offers encouragement.","Heron, Philip J.

"The question of why so many people leave science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) jobs continues to echo through social science research and Government policy. This is not surprising given the considerable investments into uptake and quality of STEM education and that STEM workers have a pivotal role to play in addressing current and future grand challenges. Yet, too many individuals with tertiary degrees in STEM-disproportionately women, racial minorities, and the underprivileged-leave or pursue careers in non-STEM fields. While demand for employment in STEM continues to grow, such persistent STEM defections present a significant challenge. We offer an integrative special issue of eight empirical articles capturing current thinking and evidence on employee retention and turnover, both within and beyond the realm of STEM. Our thematic analysis of the articles reveals overarching themes around the fundamental question of why people choose to stay in their jobs and why they leave. From this, we provide a future research agenda recognizing the myriad work and nonwork factors influencing the desire and ability to stay in one's chosen profession, particularly in critical sectors where gender and minority attrition rates prevail.","Kiazad, Kohyar Restubog, Simon Lloyd D.

"STEM, the integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects is a popular topic as schools grapple with how to best prepare students for an ever-evolving society. As societal and technological challenges emerge, design thinking has been lauded as a method to enable people to help tackle those challenges. The steps of the design thinking process, empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test align with engineering design and can be used as a problem-solving method in classrooms to help promote creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration. The purpose of this explanatory sequential mixed methods study was to better understand if a STEM integrated curriculum helps promote design thinking in middle schoolers. The study compared two middle school groups, one that uses an integrated STEM curriculum and one that does not. Quantitative data was collected using the design thinking disposition survey through pre and post testing. Qualitative data was collected through free response questions and student and teacher interviews. There was no difference found in the change of design thinking dispositions between students at the two schools, however both groups scored lowest on the design thinking disposition of prototype. Free response questions showed that students at the STEM integrated school perceived an increased ability to design solutions to problems. Student and teacher interviews highlighted benefits of using a STEM integrated curriculum including providing collaborative opportunities to solve hands-on, open-ended problems. How a STEM integrated curriculum can develop design thinking should continue to be examined.","Thomason, Dina Hsu, Pei-Ling",,"Thomason, D Hsu, PL",,"[Thomason, Dina; Hsu, Pei-Ling] Univ Texas El Paso, Coll Educ, Dept Teacher Educ, Room 813,Educ Bldg,500 W Univ Ave El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,,,,,2025-01-19,Design thinking; STEM education; Middle school; Engineering design,10.1007/s10798-024-09894-6,Article; Early Access,APR 2024,1573-1804,dthomason@miners.utep.edu,,,,,NO8I7,QUALITATIVE DATA-ANALYSIS; SCIENCE; EDUCATION,,INT J TECHNOL DES ED,Int.

"If we truly wish to promote science or STEM education, then it would seem that the joining of resources and expertise from the communities of formal schooling and informal science education institutions or ISEIs (museums, aquariums, and the like) would be an important early step. Yet creating such connections between teacher and museum remain a challenge for both teachers and informal educators. This study employs a communities of practice lens (Wenger, 1998) to provide a deeper explanation for the challenges inherent in those programs and experiences (field trips, outreach programs, teacher professional development) where schools and informal science institutions interact to create unique learning opportunities. To better understand the expectations and perceived challenges of these boundary activities, questionnaires, focus groups and interviews were used to gather information from over 200 teachers and informal science institution staff in southern California. Several factors, identified by both groups, were found to influence these shared experiences, including issues of authority, capacity, communication, and complexity. By considering both educators' perspectives, we gain a clearer understanding of the practice of these communities and how such practices influence the activities at these boundaries. Furthermore, a closer look at avid usersthose teachers who do successfully and regularly make use of ISEIsreveals possible avenues for strengthening such boundary activities and potentially creating a more effective merging of learning and teaching resources.

"Background: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is faced with many challenges resulting in learners' poor performance at matriculation level in South Africa. However, prior research has shown that mobile learning (m-learning) can be used to alleviate the challenges of STEM education. Prior research focused on tertiary institutions' students and lecturers, in developed countries. However, very little is known about rural school STEM teachers' and learners' acceptance of m-learning. Objectives: The article investigates factors that rural-based STEM teachers and learners consider important when adopting mobile learning. Furthermore, the study also seeks to examine if there is a statistically significant difference between teachers' and learners' acceptance of mobile learning. Method: The research employed a quantitative approach. Stratified random sampling was used to select 350 teachers and learners to participate in the survey. Valid questionnaires received were 288 (82%), and data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Results: The proposed model explained 64% of the variance in rural-based STEM teachers' and learners' behavioural intention to use m-learning. Perceived attitude towards use was found to be the best predictor of teachers' and learners' behavioural intention. The results also showed no significant difference between teachers' and learners' path coefficients. Conclusion: The research recommends that awareness campaigns, infrastructure, mobile devices and data need to be made available for m-learning to be successfully adopted in rural areas.","Mutambara, David Bayaga, Anass",a1200,"Mutambara, D Bayaga, A",,"[Mutambara, David; Bayaga, Anass] Univ Zululand, Fac Educ, Dept Maths Sci & Technol Educ, Richards Bay, South Africa.",University of Zululand,,,,,2025-01-19,technology acceptance model; perceived social influence; perceived resources; STEM; perceived usefulness; perceived ease of use; perceived ease to collaborate,10.4102/sajim.v22i1.1200,Article,,1560-683X,bayagaa@unizulu.ac.za,,,,,OE1WQ,USER ACCEPTANCE; PERCEIVED EASE; ADOPTION,1,S AFR J INFORM MANAG,S.

"The dearth of historically underrepresented minorities (URMs) in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty positions is one of the most significant challenges in higher education in the U.S. Increasing underrepresented groups' success in academia through achieving and retention in tenure-track faculty roles has been the central goal of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program. In the present study, we draw on organizational change theories in higher education reform and interpret the landscape of AGEP project alliances through mapping their theories of change, barriers to success, levels of change, and foci of change, based on semistructured interviews with 17 AGEP alliances' core teams. Our mapping reveals local structures as well as interesting patterns across AGEP alliances that inform national trends. We identify alignment and misalignment between our analysis frameworks and AGEP projects which amplifies contemporary questions of providing direct student support within a deficit mindset context as well as sustainability and scalability for both the AGEP community and the broader community of diversifying STEM.","Wu, Jue Hokanson, Sarah Chobot Goldberg, Bennett B.",,"Wu, J Hokanson, SC Goldberg, BB",371,"[Wu, Jue] Univ Calif Berkeley, Math & Phys Sci Deans Off, 101 Durant Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.

"Science as a Human Endeavour (SHE) is an innovative strand of the most recent Australian Curriculum: Science. The introduction of SHE is welcome and comes at a time when Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education is under increasing scrutiny both in Australia and across the world, with some commentators identifying a possible crisis. Such an adventurous addition to the curriculum, however well-intentioned, was always going to provoke significant challenges to the repertoires and pedagogical approaches of many teachers, and particularly early career teachers. This project aimed to link three important elements of science education: pedagogy related to SHE, concepts of critical pedagogy and the professional learning of teachers through practitioner inquiry. We document how three early career teachers of science, all teaching in low socio-economic schools in challenging circumstances, found ways to engage with the demands of the Australian Curriculum and redesign pedagogy for incorporating the SHE strand into their practice. These early career teachers participated in a year-long action research study into the effectiveness of their own pedagogical practices. The paper examines the challenge these teachers faced as they incorporated SHE into their teaching.","Paige, Kathryn Hardy, Graham",,"Paige, K Hardy, G",679,"[Paige, Kathryn; Hardy, Graham] Univ South Australia, Sch Educ, Mawson Lakes Campus, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia.",University of South Australia,,,,,2025-01-19,Science education; Science as a Human Endeavour; Critical pedagogy,10.1007/s10763-018-9887-x,Article,,1573-1774,kathy.paige@unisa.edu.au; graham.hardy@unisa.edu.au,699,,,,HO0JM,MATHEMATICS; TEACHERS,4,INT J SCI MATH EDUC,Int.

"Supporting student development of clear science communication skills is critically important and incredibly challenging. In this activity, to help students understand the importance of clear written communication, students work in pairs with LEGO bricks. One student with a completed LEGO structure describes a small LEGO construction, directing a second student to build it, sight unseen. This exercise serves three aims. First, it acts as an icebreaker in the beginning of this writing-intensive course; second, it prompts thinking about the features of clear communication; and finally, it highlights challenges in written communication. The exercise is followed by a short debrief and an in-class writing assignment. Most students found the exercise to be enjoyable and useful and advised including it in future course offerings. With modifications, it also runs well in an online format, and is easily adaptable to many other course contexts.

"In this contribution, we present the BioS4You project and analyse the results obtained in the first 18 months of its activity. The ""Bio-Inspired STEM topics for engaging young generations"" (BioS4You) Erasmus+ KA2 Innovation project aims to bridge the gap between STEM national curricula (which include Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and the needs of Z-generation students, uninterested to basic themes, but enthusiastic in issues related to environmental, social, and health concerns. The BioS4You project engages young learners in STEM subjects, starting with current issues of interest for them, as the social and environmental impact of new technologies, connecting STEM concepts to real-world technologies that are supporting on facing environmental, social, and health current challenges. Novel fields such as Bioengineering, Bioscience, Biotechnology can be implemented into classroom teaching, integrating academic disciplines, and stimulating the academic and social growth of young people. The knowledge of new STEM contents makes the students feel an active part of the technological innovation (and not just passive users) and help them to build a better future, bringing them closer to the STEM world and enabling them to make more informed choices for their future careers.","Persano Adorno, Dominique Mallahnia, Tahereh Koch, Volker Zailskaite-Jakste, Ligita Ostreika, Armantas Urbaityte, Ausra Punys, Vytenis Pizzolato, Nicola",774,"Adorno, DP Mallahnia, T Koch, V Zailskaite-Jakste, L Ostreika, A Urbaityte, A Punys, V Pizzolato, N",,"[Persano Adorno, Dominique] Univ Palermo, Dept Phys & Chem Segre, Viale Sci Ed 18, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.

"Climate change and associated modification of the ocean is a fact, however, it seems to be the most undervalued and little understood ""pandemic"" challenge of this century. We live in a world where environmental data is increasingly being amassed and models are generating finer scale and increasingly dense numbers of outputs, resulting in the production of high level scientific information on climate and ocean. However, the knowledge generated is often inaccessible, incomprehensible and misunderstood by society. Given that society has access to many levels of information through various forms of media, how do we better share this knowledge, and improve understanding of how society is impacting their immediate and remote surroundings and what behavioral changes are needed for reducing those impacts? In this paper, we assess the level of environmental and ocean awareness among young learners. We argue that, despite the wide range of environmental data available and a common use of a broad range of media, this group is not aware of or interested in climate related issues. This paper highlights the challenges in bringing researchers, data managers and educators together to provide consistent, up-to-date messages that can appeal to and can be understood by modern societies. It also highlights insufficiencies in environmental school education, including those concerning the ""uncertainty"" concept, which is a fundamental part of any scientific process. In identifying these challenges, we propose a pathway for improving societal knowledge on climate and ocean changes that takes advantage of the technological abilities for environmental data collection, storage and processing, global and regional research, as well as good practices in ocean literacy and climate and ocean education.","Zielinski, Tymon Bolzacchini, Ezio Evans, Karen Ferrero, Luca Gregorczyk, Klaudia Kijewski, Tomasz Kotynska-Zielinska, Izabela Mrowiec, Patrycja Oleszczuk, Barbara Pakszys, Paulina Piechowska, Ewa Piwowarczyk, Joanna Sobieszczanski, Jan Wichorowski, Marcin",,"Zielinski, T Bolzacchini, E Evans, K Ferrero, L Gregorczyk, K Kijewski, T Kotynska-Zielinska, I Mrowiec, P Oleszczuk, B Pakszys, P Piechowska, E Piwowarczyk, J Sobieszczanski, J Wichorowski, M",,"[Zielinski, Tymon; Gregorczyk, Klaudia; Kijewski, Tomasz; Oleszczuk, Barbara; Pakszys, Paulina; Piechowska, Ewa; Piwowarczyk, Joanna; Wichorowski, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Sopot, Poland.

"The COVID-19 pandemic shifted pathology education in medical schools worldwide towards online delivery. To achieve this goal, various innovative platforms were used by pathology educators and medical students, facilitating both synchronous and asynchronous learning. The aim of this study was to review the published evidence regarding remote pathology teaching at the medical school level during this period, present our own experience, and provide some perspectives regarding the best mode of pathology teaching post-pandemic. Among its advantages, virtual pathology education was considered among students and educators as convenient, flexible, and engaging, while learning outcomes were met and students' academic performance was in general satisfactory. However, several challenges were faced. For instance, suboptimal internet connection compromised the flow of classes and was even associated with a lower academic performance. The lack of hands-on laboratory activities, such as operating the light microscope and tissue grossing, and the reduced student interactions among themselves and their instructors, were also pointed out as significant drawbacks of remote pathology education. Whereas online education has multiple advantages, experiencing the physical university environment, in-person interactions and teamwork, exposure to the ""hidden curriculum"", and hands-on activities are vital for medical school education and future student development. In conclusion, the implementation of a blended approach in pathology education-where online and face-to-face sessions are jointly used to promote students' engagement, interaction with their instructors and peers, and learning-could be the most optimal approach to pathology teaching in medical schools post-pandemic.","Ishak, Angela AlRawashdeh, Mousa M.

"OBJECTIVES: Traditional surgical teaching is influenced by restrictive factors, such as financial pressures and ethical constraints. The teaching of surgical skills during a medical school education seems not to be robust enough at present, possibly resulting in stressful circumstance for surgical novices. However, the authors are convinced that practical training is fundamental for preparing medical students optimally for challenges in the operating theater and have, therefore, examined a novel method of teaching basic surgical skills to medical students. METHODS: A total of 20 medical students received surgical skill training, which included theoretical lessons, working with ex vivo pig training models, and active participation in the operating theater. All the trainees took written tests and were rated in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination. Before and after training, the students completed a self-assessment form involving the choice of the correct surgical indication and the performance of surgical procedures. RESULTS: The students' performance in the written examination and in the Objective Structured Clinical Examination increased significantly after training (p <= 0.001). Furthermore, the evaluation of the self-assessment form revealed significant improvements in all categories (p <= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our surgical training method appears to improve the surgical abilities of medical students and to increase their self-confidence with respect to surgical procedures. Therefore, the authors recommend the integration of this method into the medical school curriculum to prepare medical students well for surgical challenges.

"In terms of scale, shock, and disenfranchisement, the disruption to formal education arising from COVID-19 has been unprecedented. Anecdotally, responses from teachers and educators around the world range from heightened caution to being inspired by distance education as the ""new normal. "" Of all the challenges, face-to-face and formal teaching have been most heavily affected. Despite some education systems demonstrating resilience, a major challenge is sustaining quality and inclusiveness in formal education suddenly delivered at a distance. In probing these issues, this article profiles international perspectives on the role of open education in responding to the impact on formal school and higher education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We proceed by highlighting and analysing practices and case studies from 13 countries representing all global regions, identifying and discussing the challenges and opportunities that have presented themselves. Reports cover the period from the beginning of 2020 until 11 March 2021, the first anniversary of the COVID-19 outbreak as declared by the World Health Organization. In our comparative study, we identify seven key aspects of which three (missing infrastructure and sharing OER, open education and access to OER, and urgent need for professional development and training for teachers) are directly related to open education at a distance. After comparing examples of existing practice, we make recommendations and offer insights into how open education strategies can lead to interventions that are effective and innovative-to improve formal education at a distance in schools and universities in the future.","Stracke, Christian M.

"Background: Early detection and timely management of issues pertaining to breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum period are of utmost importance since these challenges are the important risk factors for lactation problems. To assess breastfeeding difficulties in the immediate postpartum period, breastfeeding practice among participants as per IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness) Guidelines, and various determinants of breastfeeding difficulties. Methods: This hospital-based cross- sectional study assessed recently delivered mothers in the postnatal ward during the first 48 hours postpartum conducted at Ahmedabad, India. The inclusion criteria entailed being admitted to the postpartum/postnatal ward, normal/cesarean delivery, and provision of written consent. After applying the exclusion criteria, 343 participants were included in final analysis. Observations were made regarding signs of good position and attachments as per IMNCI guidelines. Results: More than half of the participants (56.9%) were aged 21- 25 years, and 53.6% of them had primary/secondary school education. Breast pain was the most common difficulty reported (47.52%), followed by less secretion of milk (25.07%). Other difficulties reported were sore nipples, breast heaviness, inverted nipples, backache, giddiness, as well as headache and perineal pain at the site of stitches. ""Good attachment"" and ""good positioning"" were found in 62.16% and 60.96% of participants, respectively. The majority of participants (52.08%) had the perception that their newborn was not sucking effectively. Conclusion: Mothers' age, numbers of live births, and mixed feeding were statistically significantly associated with good attachment. Good positioning was statistically significantly correlated with less secretion of milk. Duration of starting breastfeeding after birth and breast pain were significantly associated with both.","Dave, Viral Solanki, Asha Rathod, Vasu Shah, Venu Shukla, Rujul",,"Dave, V Solanki, A Rathod, V Shah, V Shukla, R",8,"[Dave, Viral; Solanki, Asha; Rathod, Vasu; Shah, Venu; Shukla, Rujul] GCS Med Coll Hosp & Res Ctr, Community Med Dept, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Attachment; Breastfeeding; Difficulties; Position; Post-partum,10.22038/IJN.2022.65115.2262,Article,,2322-2158,dr.vdave@gmail.com,14,,,,6M4XR,,3,IRAN J NEONATOL,Iran.

"Objective To assess challenges to optimal rheumatology care from the perspective of patients served by our institution's rheumatology division. Design setting and participants Focus group study of adult rheumatic disease patients who attend clinics at a university teaching hospital in Montreal, Canada. Interventions Individuals participated in 1-h focus group discussions concerning their experiences and beliefs regarding rheumatology care. Sessions were recorded and transcripts generated. A thematic analysis approach was used by two individual analyzers. Main outcome measures and results Eighteen patients participated in three focus groups (group one = 8 patients; group two = 5; group three = 5). Eleven patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, 6 had rheumatoid arthritis, and 1 patient had psoriatic arthritis. The average age (standard deviation) was 51.2 (14.0) years, disease duration 23.5 (14.5) years, and in the majority had at least a high school education. All participants were female and 72.2% were Caucasian. Three main themes emerged: theme 1 identified patients' needs for information and support, at diagnosis and throughout the disease trajectory; theme 2 identified barriers to accessing health care: theme 3 identified patients' beliefs regarding improvements needed to optimize their experiences throughout the disease course. Conclusions Our focus group study not only clarified the needs of rheumatology patients with chronic inflammatory disease, and identified barriers to optimal rheumatology care, but also was a source of recommendations that might improve patient experiences in seeking health care in a rheumatology setting. Limitations include the fact that our participants were all female, and mostly were middle aged, Caucasian and well educated. Regardless, the findings can help inform efforts to improve rheumatology care.","Dollinger, J. Neville, C. Pineau, C. A. Vinet, E. Hazel, E. Lee, J. L. F.

"The authors examine the potential impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on a large medical education program in the Northwest United States that builds the primary care workforce for its largely rural region. The 42-year-old Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) program, hosted by the University of Washington School of Medicine, is one of the nation's most successful models for rural health training. The program has expanded training and retention of primary care health professionals for the region through medical school education, graduate medical education, a physician assistant training program, and support for practicing health professionals. The ACA and resulting accountable care organizations (ACOs) present potential challenges for rural settings and health training programs like WWAMI that focus on building the health workforce for rural and underserved populations. As more Americans acquire health coverage, more health professionals will be needed, especially in primary care. Rural locations may face increased competition for these professionals. Medical schools are expanding their positions to meet the need, but limits on graduate medical education expansion may result in a bottleneck, with insufficient residency positions for graduating students. The development of ACOs may further challenge building a rural workforce by limiting training opportunities for health professionals because of competing demands and concerns about cost, efficiency, and safety associated with training. Medical education programs like WWAMI will need to increase efforts to train primary care physicians and increase their advocacy for student programs and additional graduate medical education for rural constituents.","Allen, Suzanne M.

"Background: Challenges to retention in prenatal care seem to exist under both universal systems of care, as in Canada, and non-universal systems of care, as in the United States. However, among populations being served by a system of publicly funded health care, the barriers are less well understood and universal uptake of prenatal services has not been realized. Determining the characteristics of women who dropped out of a prenatal care randomized controlled trial can help identify those who may need alternate retention and service approaches. Methods: In this study, pregnant women were randomized to: a) current standard of care; b) 'a' plus nursing support; or c) 'b' plus a paraprofessional home visitor. 16% of 2,015 women did not complete all three telephone interviews ( 197 dropped out and 124 became unreachable). Responders were compared to non-responders on demographics, lifestyle, psychosocial factors, and life events using chi-squared tests. Logistic regression models were constructed using stepwise logistic regression to determine the probability of not completing the prenatal program. Results: Completion rates did not differ by intervention. In comparison to responders, non-responders were more likely to be younger, less educated, have lower incomes, smoke, have low social support, have a history of depression, and have separated or divorced parents ( all p < 0.05). Unreachable women were more likely to be single, use drugs, report distress and adverse life events (all p < 0.05). Non-Caucasian women were more likely to drop out (p = 0.002). Logistic regression modeling indicated that independent key risk factors for dropping out were: less than high school education, separated or divorced parents, lower social support, and being non-Caucasian. Pregnant women who were single/separated/divorced, less than 25 years old, had less than high school education, earned less than $40,000 in annual household income, and/or smoked had greater odds of becoming unreachable at some point during pregnancy and not completing the study. Conclusion: Women at risk due to lifestyle and challenging circumstances were difficult to retain in a prenatal care study, regardless of the intervention. For women with complex health, lifestyle and social issues, lack of retention may reflect incongruence between their needs and the program.

"Background and objectives: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex multi-system disease with a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and their families, yet the majority of ME/CFS patients go unrecognised or undiagnosed. For two decades, the medical education establishment in the UK has been challenged to remedy these failings, but little has changed. Meanwhile, there has been an exponential increase in biomedical research and an international paradigm shift in the literature, which defines ME/CFS as a multisystem disease, replacing the psychogenic narrative. This study was designed to explore the current UK medical school education on ME/CFS and to identify challenges and opportunities relating to future ME/CFS medical education. Materials and methods: A questionnaire, developed under the guidance of the Medical Schools Council, was sent to all 34 UK medical schools to collect data for the academic year 2018-2019. Results: Responses were provided by 22 out of a total of 34 medical schools (65%); of these 13/22 (59%) taught ME/CFS, and teaching was led by lecturers from ten medical specialties. Teaching delivery was usually by lecture; discussion, case studies and e-learning were also used. Questions on ME/CFS were included by seven schools in their examinations and three schools reported likely clinical exposure to ME/CFS patients. Two-thirds of respondents were interested in receiving further teaching aids in ME/CFS. None of the schools shared details of their teaching syllabus, so it was not possible to ascertain what the students were being taught. Conclusions: This exploratory study reveals inadequacies in medical school teaching on ME/CFS. Many medical schools (64% of respondents) acknowledge the need to update ME/CFS education by expressing an appetite for further educational materials. The General Medical Council (GMC) and Medical Schools Council (MSC) are called upon to use their considerable influence to bring about the appropriate changes to medical school curricula so future doctors can recognise, diagnose and treat ME/CFS. The GMC is urged to consider creating a registered specialty encompassing ME/CFS, post-viral fatigue and long Covid.","Muirhead, Nina Muirhead, John Lavery, Grace Marsh, Ben",542,"Muirhead, N Muirhead, J Lavery, G Marsh, B",,"[Muirhead, Nina] Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, Amersham Hosp, Whielden St, Amersham HP7 0JD, England.

"Teaching artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging challenge in global school education. There are considerable barriers to overcome, including the existing practices of technology education and teachers' knowledge of AI. Research evidence shows that studying teachers' experiences can be beneficial in informing how appropriate design in teaching sustainable AI should evolve. Design frames characterize teachers' design reasoning and can substantially influence their AI lesson design considerations. This study examined 18 experienced teachers' perceptions of teaching AI and identified effective designs to support AI instruction. Data collection methods involved semi-structured interviews, action study, classroom observation, and post-lesson discussions with the purpose of analyzing the teachers' perceptions of teaching AI. Grounded theory was employed to detail how teachers understand the pedagogical challenges of teaching AI and the emerging pedagogical solutions from their perspectives. Results reveal that effective AI instructional design should encompass five important components: (1) obstacles to and facilitators of participation in teaching AI, (2) interactive design thinking processes, (3) teachers' knowledge of teaching AI, (4) orienteering AI knowledge for social good, and (5) the holistic understanding of teaching AI. The implications for future teacher AI professional development activities are proposed.","Lin, Xiao-Fan Chen, Lu Chan, Kan Kan Peng, Shiqing Chen, Xifan Xie, Siqi Liu, Jiachun Hu, Qintai",7811,"Lin, XF Chen, L Chan, KK Peng, SQ Chen, XF Xie, SQ Liu, JC Hu, QT",,"[Lin, Xiao-Fan] South China Normal Univ, Guangdong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Smart Learn, Guangdong Prov Inst Elementary Educ & Informat Te, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China.

"One of the main challenges of the current school education system is responding appropriately to students' diversity within the classroom. As an instructional approach that acknowledges students' diversity, differentiated instruction has been increasingly recognised as an important means for inclusive education. Despite its recognised advantages, only a few teachers consistently implement it for various reasons. Considering the importance of differentiation for developing an inclusive education and the fact that curriculum planning is essential for effective differentiation, this paper aims to explore the correlation between teachers' assumptions and beliefs regarding curriculum and curriculum planning and the difficulties they perceive in designing and implementing differentiated instructional plans. To achieve this goal, researchers developed an in-service training programme that spanned the entire school year, involving six teachers as research cases. Data collection methods included reflective portfolios, interviews, and observation of teachers' lessons. Results showed that when teachers were challenged to plan a differentiated lesson, they became aware of their mindset, were able to reflect on it, and consistently changed some of their teaching practices. They also showed that teachers' mindsets regarding curriculum and curriculum planning were related to how they perceived difficulties in designing and implementing their instructional plans.","Maia, Vitor Freire, Sofia",,"Maia, V Freire, S",,"[Maia, Vitor; Freire, Sofia] Univ Lisbon, Inst Educ, Lisbon, Portugal.

"In China, the government had created a policy-friendly educational setting for rural migrant children for a long period after 2001. Yet in 2013, in some metropolitan areas such as Beijing and Shanghai, the schooling policy retuned to more demanding criteria, bringing hardships to many migrant families. This paper examines the power relations underlying the formation of the post-2013 restrictive policy. Utilizing Foucauldian theoretical resources, it develops the work of Bowe, Ball and Gold on policy cycle and produces an updated analytical framework. The findings show that the discursive formation permeating the four coexisting and permeable contexts of the policy trajectory legitimizes the following statements: recruiting migrant children leads to declining educational quality; state school education is a restricted type of social welfare open only to the ""contributors to the city""; and standardization is necessary for school enrolment practice. The power relations lie beneath the discursive practices are the exam-orientated education discourse and the disciplinary power of the privileged over the dominated, which objectivize migrants as ""outsiders"" and a risk to educational quality. This paper demonstrates the analytical capacity of Foucauldian theoretical resources for policy analysis in the Chinese context.","Yu, Hui",,"Yu, H",440,"[Yu, Hui] South China Normal Univ, Sch Educ, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China.",South China Normal University,,,,,2025-01-19,Migrant children; China; Foucault; discourse; policy cycle; educational policy,10.1080/02188791.2020.1806034,Article,AUG 2020,1742-6855,hui.yu@m.scnu.edu.cn,453,,"Guangzhou Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [2019GZGJ41, 2019GZYB33]; Guangdong Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [GD18YJY02]","This work was supported Guangzhou Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [grant number 2019GZGJ41 and 2019GZYB33], and by Guangdong Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [grant number GD18YJY02].",TY2GN,CHILDREN; EDUCATION; CHALLENGES; SHANGHAI; FIELD,3,ASIA PAC J EDUC,Asia Pac.

"Border regions in which formal and informal environments are culturally diverse provide fertile ground for research in Language Studies and the Human Sciences and make it possible to discuss and expand investigations into the linguistic and educational reality that exists in these plural contexts. In this way, bibliographic reviews become necessary ways to compose inventories of academic productions aimed at understanding the subject in focus. Our aim in this article is initially to present a survey of doctoral studies that approach the subject of education in Brazilian border contexts, with the aim of identifying which issues have been addressed in academic productions, and what challenges and contributions emerge from and for these border contexts. In addition, we mapped which of these studies articulate linguistic issues and phenomena that occur in elementary school contexts. The method used was bibliographical research and we systematically reviewed the literature on the proposed topic. We used the Capes portal (Theses and Dissertations) as our database and only focused on those research theses produced in the last decade (from 2014 to 2023). As a result, we obtained a significant overview of the various educational and linguistic realities experienced in different border contexts and which encourage future research.","de Oliveira, Catia Regina Guidio Alves de Oliveira, Renata Alves Berger, Isis Ribeiro",,"de Oliveira, CRGA de Oliveira, RA Berger, IR",35,"[de Oliveira, Catia Regina Guidio Alves] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, Soc Cultura & Fronteiras, Cascavel, Brazil.

"Under Communism, the Catholic Church in Poland played the role of guarantor of preserving the national traditions and defender of freedom. Such was one of reasons for removing religion from the state school curriculum by the government of Poland in 1961. The political transformation of 1989 changed the concept of the Polish state. Religion as a subject of school education was restored to state (public) schools in 1990 immediately after the political watershed. It was given a confessional and optional character. Although Poland is a pluralistic country (over 180 denominations) the dominant cultural and political role is played by the Roman Catholic Church. In this article we address the problems that appear in the context of religious instruction taught in world-view neutral public schools of Poland. We are not so much interested in detailed issues related to the teaching of religion sensu stricto, but in the presence of religion as such in state schools. We consider the pedagogical problem formulated in this way in the context of the legal principle of the world-view neutrality of the state in a democratic, pluralistic and at the same time hyper-religious society.","Milerski, Boguslaw Zielinski, Tadeusz J.",,"Milerski, B Zielinski, TJ",288,"[Milerski, Boguslaw; Zielinski, Tadeusz J.] Christian Theol Acad, Dept Social Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Religious education; inclusive education; public school and the government's world-view neutrality,10.1080/01416200.2022.2049208,Article,MAR 2022,1740-7931,b.milerski@chat.edu.pl; t.zielinski@chat.edu.pl,300,,,,J1VG7,,3,BRIT J RELIG EDUC,Brit.

"The crisis humanity faces with the spreading of the new Coronavirus is undeniable. The pandemic context has profoundly impacted the dynamics of the world of work, causing changes in the functioning of the organizations that adopted a remote model, outstandingly, the institutions of school education. The present study approaches an integrative online educational experience developed along with the extension project ""Dialogues about Cultural Capital and Praxis of FIRN - International Edition"". The purpose is to analyze the content of interviews made by young researchers of the post graduation program of Educational Sciences of the Minho University (Portugal), published in Jornal Potiguar Noticias, aiming to reflect about the educational experience in pandemic times. The time frame of the interviews comprised the months of June and July of 2020. The methodological procedure used was based on thematic analysis, with aid of the software NVivo12, in which it were inferred topics that were broken down into themes and subthemes about the subjects raised on twenty-three interviews. Despite of countless challenges faced, the results point out that the remote education context has mobilized teachers, students, and families for the complex and creative exercise of education mediated by information and communication technologies.","Tavares, A.

"The Salafi manhaj (method) is emerging as a new form of Islamic education, in addition to the existing pesantren (Islamic boarding school) and madrasah (Islamic school) education systems, both of which have long histories in Indonesia. The presence of these schools reflects Salafi efforts to achieve p""urification of Islam"" though adherence to the idea of returning to the 'authentic Islam' as practiced by the early generations of Muslim. Salafi manhaj schools are also part of a transnational Islamic movement that has purposely spread ideas and movements from the Middle East around the world, including to Indonesia. Over time, these schools have developed into two models: Integrated Islamic Schools and Salafi manhaj pesantrens. Both aim to instill Islamic tenets that comply with the Salafi manhaj and disseminate and incorporate such tenets in the religious practices of Indonesian Muslims, although the Integrated Islamic Schools are more inclusive and teach aspects of the conventional state curriculum too. This article challenges previous findings that the influence of Salafi education has faded in Indonesia as efforts to combat Islamist terrorism globally have increased, arguing that Salafi educators have been strategic and effective in promoting their approach to religious education.","Jamhari Asrori, Saifudin",,"Jamhari Asrori, S",227,"[Jamhari] Univ Islam Int Indonesia UIII, Depok, Indonesia.

"The article reviews some learning objectives in the Norwegian core curriculum for four subjects in compulsory school education, namely science, social science, mathematics, and physical education. The subjects are examined with respect to maps, including map use, digital mapping tools, coordinate systems, and scales. Primary and lower secondary school pupils' knowledge of maps was investigated before and after a group mapping project. Among three indicators, two showed statistically significant improvements in the pupils' level of confidence when studying data with the aid of maps. The learning outcome is discussed in an inquiry-based and interdisciplinary pedagogical frame. In addition, the findings reveal that the four subjects have significantly different objectives and rates of progression regarding maps and map use. Based on the results of the group project, the author argues in favour of bringing the four curricula into more parallel learning curves. In order to facilitate interdisciplinary projects, he considers it would be interesting to coordinate the different subject curricula in the future, and recommends that attempts should be made to harmonise competence objectives that are part of several subjects in order to facilitate interdisciplinary projects in the next revision of the core curriculum in Norway.","Cyvin, Jardar",,"Cyvin, J",162,"Sor Trondelag Univ Coll, Dept Teacher & Interpreter Educ, NO-7004 Trondheim, Norway.",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),,,,,2025-01-19,GPS and GIS; interdisciplinary teaching; maps; Norwegian core curriculum; primary and lower secondary schools,10.1080/00291951.2013.804877,Article,,,jardar.cyvin@hist.no,171,,,,171GF,,3,NORSK GEOGR TIDSSKR,Norsk.

"This study investigated senior South African high school students' levels of knowledge, perception, attitude, and awareness toward nuclear energy using paper-based, semi-structured questionnaires and digital data collection instruments through online Google forms. The sample consisted of 100 high school students from two schools. Fifty students were chosen from a public school, and fifty students were selected from a private/independent school. It was found that regardless of the type of school, students showed little to no knowledge, low awareness, and significant ignorance of nuclear energy. The majority of students had never heard of nuclear energy. In terms of initial exposure to the concept of nuclear energy, private school learners seemed to have been exposed to the industry more through television. In contrast, for public school learners, educators were their main sources of introduction. Conversely, the perception of this form of energy is much more positive in private schools than in public schools. This study highlights the existence of a severe gap in high school education regarding the teaching and learning of nuclear energy. Hence, an energy-cognizant curriculum is needed to bridge the gap in both public and private schools.","Ewim, Daniel Raphael Ejike Nundlal, Yasthil Govender, Keenan Nzuke, Nokubonga Lungile Mbatha, Mfanafuthi Vukani Gwexa, Nangamso Naidoo, Kelsi Laseinde, Opeyeolu T.

"Although studying music at school can be an enriching and enjoyable experience, it is an unpopular choice for many Hong Kong senior secondary students. The purpose of this study was to examine the rationale behind the low enrolment of music as a Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) subject. A questionnaire was conducted among senior secondary school students (N = 121) studying music at the HKDSE level, collecting information about their learning experiences and their perceptions of the curriculum. The results provided evidence supporting the difficulties and struggles faced by the students, including degrees of familiarity with, and confidence about, subject matters of different musical cultures, which subjects were prioritised when it came to studying, and the amount of prior specialist knowledge needed as part of the decision-making process. Tensions were revealed between the driving forces behind curriculum change and the readiness of students to cope with these changes, along with perceptions of music as an elitist subject with low utilitarian value. Socio-cultural interventions, such as making music education more accessible for all, while simultaneously ensuring that stakeholders' voices are heard as part of the decolonisation process, remain fundamental challenges facing the curriculum.","Cheng, Lee",,"Cheng, L",413,"[Cheng, Lee] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Cambridge, England.",Anglia Ruskin University,,,,,2025-01-19,Curriculum development; decolonisation; examination; Hong Kong; music education,10.1177/02557614221115882,Article,AUG 2022,1744-795X,lee.cheng@aru.ac.uk,427,,,,L4JQ1,TEACHING CANTONESE OPERA; STUDENTS MOTIVATION; TEACHERS; STATE,3,INT J MUSIC EDUC,Int.

"Pursuing Sustainable Development Goal 4 has led to more children and youth accessing schooling than at any point in history. However, this expansion of provision has not been without workforce challenges. UNESCO modelling indicates a global shortfall of 44 million teachers by 2030. The challenge of having a sufficiently qualified school education workforce where it is needed is amplified in locations where affordable quality stock of housing is limited. With most of the world's population urbanising, cities represent a new frontier in understanding the complexity of current and forthcoming teacher shortages, with significant public policy implications. Interventions aimed at individual workers, schools, or administrative boundaries have failed to arrest staff shortages as they are frequently applied too late or based on potential rather than realised data. This paper develops a novel measure, the Workforce Catchment Area (WFCA), and tests its applicability in the Australian city of Sydney. Analysis demonstrates that when integrated with housing and transportation costs it is possible to identify workforce distribution as a contributor to teacher shortages, and generate the data and evidence required by policy makers to set explicit policy goals and markers of success.","Eacott, Scott",103110,"Eacott, S",,"[Eacott, Scott] UNSW Sydney, Sch Educ, Room G17,Morven Brown Bldg, Sydney 2052, Australia.",University of New South Wales Sydney,,,,,2025-01-19,Teacher housing; Workforce distribution; Housing affordability; Workforce; Catchment; Housing,10.1016/j.ijedudev.2024.103110,Article,AUG 2024,1873-4871,s.eacott@unsw.edu.au,,,,,E0W9B,CARE SERVICE AREAS; PREFERENCES; PATTERNS,,INT J EDUC DEV,Int.

"Education is crucial for individual growth and national development. India, with its ambitious School Education Vision 2030, aims to overcome persistent challenges in achieving universal education. This study examines the complex issue of student dropout, specifically focusing on the secondary level in Tamil Nadu, by analyzing the demographic profiles of 846 students. Machine Learning classification approaches such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Random Forest demonstrate impressive performances, with Random Forest standing out as a powerful tool for accurate prediction. In dropout prediction, survival analysis approaches, specifically the Random Survival Forest (RSF) model, outperform the Weibull model. Through variable importance analysis, age and attendance are found to be significant factors, emphasizing their critical role in predicting dropout events. This study pioneers the integration of survival analysis and machine learning-based classification in the Indian educational context, contributing to the improvement of dropout prediction models. The combined approach enhances the accuracy of dropout prediction and temporal understanding. Despite its cohort-specific focus, the study provides valuable insights for future research and interventions, supporting inclusive education in India by integrating essential characteristics in predictive models.","Venkatesan, Raghul Gandhi Mappillairaju, Bagavandas",,"Venkatesan, RG Mappillairaju, B",2309,"[Venkatesan, Raghul Gandhi] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Math, Kattankulathur 603203, Tamil Nadu, India.

"Background: Current educational policies for children involved with the Child Protective Services (CPS) system focus largely on the minority of children currently in or aging out of foster care, and target school stability and college access. Objective: The present study investigates the nature of secondary (high school) education performance and attainment and post -secondary (college) enrollment among youth with prior or current CPS contact and their low-income, but not CPS -contacted, peers. Method: Following a cohort of over 63,000 high school students in Wisconsin, we use CPS investigation and placement records, and public school records to evaluate associations between CPS involvement and educational attainment. Results: CPS -contacted youth have lower educational performance and greater academic challenges than their low-income peers. Youth aging out of care are uniquely disadvantaged with regard to on -time high school completion but complete high school and enroll in college at equal or higher rates than reunified youth. Across all groups, 55-75 % of those who graduated on time with ""basic"" or above English and math skills enrolled in college. Foster care experiences, such as time in care and placement instability, were not consistently associated with educational outcomes. Conclusion: Efforts to improve secondary education experiences are needed to bolster college and career pathways for disadvantaged youth.","Font, Sarah Palmer, Lindsey",106680,"Font, S Palmer, L",,"[Font, Sarah] Penn State Univ, Sociol & Publ Policy, State Coll, PA USA.

"There are many critical points or ""black spots"" in our secondary school education system that should be examined and eliminated as part of a more profound reform of the school system and not ignored, as was the case with the last attempt at curriculum reform. It seems that we do not have a clear view of the historical situation and the essential goals of Croatian society and education as its most important component. The Croatian school system needs to be changed for many reasons, but not in such a way that the focus of interest is on subjects that provide operational and useful ""knowledge"" that is at the service of capital. The symbol of the last curriculum reform was a computer, i.e. a tablet! On the contrary, education should be at the center of efforts. It is obvious that with this reform we are not looking for creative efforts to find new, different and untried solutions that would best express national and general human interests in facing the great challenges of our time, but we are witnessing the mere transfer of Western, liberalcapitalist scientific and technical patterns to all areas of life and thus also to school.","Zivkovic, Mladen",,"Zivkovic, M",267,,,,,,,2025-01-19,school pathology; legal over-normativity; school bureaucracy; deprofessionalization of teachers; education for humanity,,Article,,1848-2325,mlazivko@inet.hr,284,,,,UJ8U0,,2,METOD OGL,Metod.

"The modern world, characterized by dynamic changes, rapid development of ICT and globalization processes sets new challenges to present-day education. This research aims at investigating the influence of applying verbal-performance activities in foreign language education. A pedagogical experiment was conducted in authentic environment with the participation of 99 pupils aged 10 to 11 who formed an experimental and a control group. The study combined qualitative and quantitative approach. It measured pupils' entry and exit levels of practical English knowledge and communicative skills and also traced the effect of the experimental education on the pupils from the experimental group. The interpretative analyses of the results revealed that applying verbal-performance activities in foreign language education led to higher achievements in terms of knowledge and communicative competence for the pupils from the experimental group compared to the progress of the children from the control group. A measurement of the attitude of the pupils from the experimental group towards applying verbal-performance activities in the educational process proved the potential of the method to increase children's motivation for learning. The findings of this research confirm the need of further studies on the influence of applying verbal-performance activities in a broader context of school education.","Dyankova, Gergana Mladenova, Maya",,"Dyankova, G Mladenova, M",93,"[Dyankova, Gergana] South West Unvers Neofit Rilski, Fac Pedag, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria.",,,,,,2025-01-19,verbal-performance activities; foreign language education; communicative skills; motivation for learning,10.23947/2334-8496-2020-8-3-93-102,Article,,2334-8496,diankova_g@swu.bg; mayaadj@yahoo.com,102,,,,PI1GI,INTONATION,3,INT J COGNITIVE RES,Int.

"This article examines the construction of epistemic injustice in creating and implementing an EMI policy. Drawing on ""epistemic injustice"" (Pricker, Miranda. 2007. Epistemic injustice: Power and the ethics of knowing. Oxford: Oxford University Press) and ""misframing"" (Fraser, Nancy. 2009. Scales of justice: Reimagining political space in a globalizing world. New York: Columbia University Press), we discuss how the EMI policy in Nepal's school education has reinforced the epistemic nature of social injustice. Taking an ethnographic approach, we have analyzed how EMI policies are created, interpreted, and implemented in two public schools located in historically marginalized ethnic minority/Indigenous communities. Our analyses show that the schools misframe and misrecognize Indigenous/ethnic minority parents' and children's linguistic knowledge and awareness of language education policy. While reproducing neoliberal values, EMI policies construct a deficit identity of Indigenous/ethnic minority communities by erasing and stigmatizing their knowledge of mother tongues in school. Such policies not only promote an English-only monolingual ideology but also pose multiple challenges for epistemic access of Indigenous/minority students and affect parents' ""party of participation"" (Fraser, Nancy. 2009.

"The article presents a research that has as object of study the Itinerant School Herdeiros do Saber of the Landless Workers Movement, Rio Bonito do Iguacu, Parana. The objective of the research was to analyze the process of transforming the pedagogical practices of the ""School of teaching"" to the ""School of work"", from the perspectives of the teachers working in that school. The case study methodology used semi-structured interviews, participant observation and field diary. The research seeks to contribute to the discussions about the school form in the movement of pedagogical transformations of rural schools. The research results show a process of construction of pedagogical practices guided by work as an educational principle, the link between school education and life and the school organization, with different times and spaces. In these areas, the main contradictions present express questions of the centrality of teaching scientific knowledge, of pedagogical and school management practices, of the training of teachers. Finally, it presents some challenges of the school experience analyzed regarding the consolidation of the school's pedagogical proposal, the lack of resources and investment and the political context of the school's social reality.","de Souza, Rose Riepe Antonio, Clesio Acilino",e10158,"de Souza, RR Antônio, CA",,"[de Souza, Rose Riepe; Antonio, Clesio Acilino] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana UNIOESTE, Ctr Ciencias Humanas CCH, Programa Posgrad Educ UNIOESTE PPGEFB, Rua Maringa 1200, Francisco Beltrao, PR, Brazil.",Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana,,,,,2025-01-19,"itinerant school; landless rural workers' movement; pedagogical practices; ""school of work""; ""school of teaching""",10.20873/uft.rbec.e10158,Article,,,rose17riepe@gmail.com,,,CAPES [001],This research was financially supported by CAPES -Funding Code 001.,XN9JF,,,REV BRAS EDUC CAMPO,Rev.

"Generation Y, one of the four generational groups, prompts distinct traits with a significant influence on the buying and consumption behaviour already greatly impacting various markets. The fashion industry must tap into the minds of the Generation Y individuals as they will be the biggest spenders for many years to come but this huge opportunity comes together with challenges induced by the heterogeneity between the different age layers, each seeking distinct benefits in their purchases. This study, performed on 400 individuals from Bucharest between 20 and 24 years old with at least a high school education, sheds light on what the young Romanian consumers look for when buying apparel. It also clarifies aspects related to fashion buying decision criteria and how different variables correlate to explain dimensions of the consumption behaviour. This population segment prompts a rather rational purchasing behaviour for clothes with a significant consideration for the brand's social value. Although the present research delivers significant insight it needs to be treated as a longitudinal study subsequent data being needed to determine the persistence of these behavioural dimensions and to unveil any new developments prompted by changes of hexogen and endogen nature.","Edu, Tudor Preda, Oana Negricea, Iliuta Costel",,"Edu, T Preda, O Negricea, IC",349,"[Edu, Tudor; Preda, Oana; Negricea, Iliuta Costel] Romanian Amer Univ, Fac Management Mkt, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,2025-01-19,consumer behaviour; fashion; Generation Y; age layers; Romania,,Article,,,tudoredu@yahoo.com; ocpreda@yahoo.com; negricea@yahoo.com,357,,,,AX1GN,,6,IND TEXTILA,Ind.

"The pace of discovery in biochemistry and genetics and its effect on clinical medicine places new curricular challenges in medical school education. We sought to evaluate students' understanding of neurogenetics and its clinical applications to design a pilot curriculum into the clinical neurology clerkship. We utilized a needs assessment and a written examination to evaluate the genetics knowledge of 81 third- and fourth-year medical students. The needs assessment surveyed students' self-perceptions of their own understanding of basic and clinically related genetic principles and clinical skills, as well as the most effective educational methods. Medical students reported more competence with basic science learned during the preclinical years than clinical concepts, and they demonstrated relatively low knowledge levels in clinical neurogenetics concepts on the examination, with an average of 29% correct on questions pertaining to genetic counseling compared with 82% correct with regard to inheritance patterns. Common, cross-specialty clinical skills were attained (e.g. internet search, family histories), while at least half of students reported minimal understanding or awareness of key genetics websites (e. g. OMIM) and indications for support group recommendations and genetics referrals. Teaching these more specific genetics skills and concepts needs to be emphasized in the clinical curriculum.","Pearl, Phillip L. Pettiford, Jennifer M. Combs, Susan E.

"Can a mandate for inclusive school education translate into reality? What challenges can undermine it in the context of a stratified schooling system? We discuss this in the context of India's landmark Right to Education Act. A controversial clause of the Act mandates that private schools should reserve at least 25 percent of entry-level seats for disadvantaged sections of the society. This paper, drawing on a detailed survey of 1642 households, and interactions with parents over 2014-2019, unpacks the experiences of households who applied for admission in private schools through the mandate. Our results suggest that more resourceful households (in terms of ability to speak official language, wealth and education) are more likely to apply, and get admissions through the mandate. Acquiring eligibility documents (proofs for income and residence) is a major hurdle in completing the application process. Even after being allotted a seat, households continue to face several barriers that make it difficult for them to secure an admission and enrol or continue sending their child to the private school through the mandate. The results are sobering, and flag the possibility that transformative potential of the mandate may not be fully realised if the status quo prevails.","Dongre, Ambrish Sarin, Ankur Singhal, Karan",,"Dongre, A Sarin, A Singhal, K",2921,"[Dongre, Ambrish; Sarin, Ankur; Singhal, Karan] Indian Inst Management IIM, C-6,New Fac Block,Heritage Campus, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.

"The curriculum in Chile has been under pressure in recent decades and, considering the implications of the pandemic, the pressure has spread and deepened. This situation has had repercussions for the curricular management of schools, where problems detected require a systemic analysis of their elements. In this article, through a review of national and international evidence, we reflect on curriculum management during the pandemic, focusing on primary school education. Tensions and challenges are addressed using the indicative performance standards currently in force in Chile as a reference. The analysis reflects the accumulation of administrative functions and responsibilities carried out by the management staff. Likewise, the analysis highlights an overloaded curriculum, lack of clarity in the use of non-instructional time, and problems in the understanding and treatment of evaluations and their link with learning objectives. We present three proposals to move forward: 1) educational policies aimed at greater curricular decentralization, based on a limited set of learning objectives at the national level and flexibility to incorporate objectives at the regional level; 2) professional development coherent with curricular design and implementation in regional teams; and 3) specific spaces for school principals to analyze pedagogical practices that allow for relevant curricular implementation.","Moreira-Arenas, Alexis Ferreira-Pinto, Israel Obregon-Reyes, Jennifer Quiero-Bastias, Maximo",,"Moreira-Arenas, A Ferreira-Pinto, I Obregón-Reyes, J Quiero-Bastías, M",53,"[Moreira-Arenas, Alexis] Univ OHiggins, Rancagua, Chile.

"Ethnic minority resources are very rich and contain rich historical resources and culture. Under the impact of modern information technology, the development of minority resources and the inheritance of ethnic culture are facing many challenges, and the current school education is lagging behind in exploring the ecological resources of minority groups, which makes the integration of creative education and minority groups encounter a bottleneck. In response to this situation, we make full use of the platform of creative education to actively explore the traditional skills contained in the lives of ethnic minorities. In the evaluation of creative education, we should not only focus on the evaluation of students' works, but also on the improvement of students' knowledge of various creative tools, their ability to use comprehensive subject knowledge, hands-on ability, solution ability and creativity ability during the whole learning process. Based on this, this paper proposes a back propagation neural network (BPNN)-based quality evaluation method for creative education to evaluate the quality of creative education from multiple dimensions. Experiments and comparisons show that the BPNN-based evaluation method proposed in this paper can better evaluate the whole process of creative education and help the further development of creative education in minority regions.","Yang, Man Huang, Haining Li, Sijing Luo, Weitai Chen, Mengzhen Li, Ling Yan, Wei",2350275,"Yang, M Huang, HN Li, SJ Luo, WT Chen, MZ Li, L Yan, W",,"[Yang, Man] Bansomdejchaopraya Rajabhat Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Bangkok 10600, Thailand.

"PurposeWhilst an urgent need for collaboration is increasingly seen in education to better respond to socio-educational challenges, in practice, collaboration between primary school teachers and their partners is hampered by barriers. The aim of this study is to shed light on these barriers from a human resource management (HRM) angle, using the ability, motivation and opportunity (AMO) framework.Design/methodology/approachQuantitative and qualitative data were collected amongst staff in 16 child centres offering joint pre-school, education and childcare.FindingsThe authors' findings suggest that in general, both teachers and childcare workers perceive themselves as skilled and motivated for collaboration. They perceive aspects of opportunity to perform as most important barriers.Practical implicationsBased on this research, school leaders are advised to organise opportunities for collaboration, especially by fostering an inclusive organisational climate and scheduling sufficient time for collaboration.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to the relatively scarce body of research on HRM within the education sector. Furthermore, it illustrates the applicability of the AMO model for gaining insight into how educational management can be utilised to foster increased collaboration between teachers and childcare workers.","Verheijen-Tiemstra, Rachel Ros, Anje Vermeulen, Marc Poell, Rob F.",,"Verheijen-Tiemstra, R Ros, A Vermeulen, M Poell, RF",96,"[Verheijen-Tiemstra, Rachel; Poell, Rob F.] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Social & Behav Sci, Dept Human Resource Studies, Tilburg, Netherlands.

"In the framework of European educational convergence, university teaching must respond to the new challenges posed by the European System of Transfer Credits (ECTS) while encouraging improvement and innovation in didactical aspects of formation. In Spain, the field of the History of Education has assumed an active role in the advancement of teaching quality by promoting projects for innovation and reform through different institutions and organisms. In this article we will describe a project for teaching innovation, supported by the Universidad Complutense of Madrid's Vice-rectory of quality, which is based on the pedagogy of Freinet. The aim of the project is to apply the Freinet methodology to the teaching of the History of Education to undergraduate students of primary education, pre-school education and pedagogy. The reasons for introducing the Freinet techniques in the university classroom have to do above all with the versatility of its methodology. The method's didactic potential in forming teachers - owing principally to its way of integrating and unifying diverse innovative methodologies from the Progressive Education movement - has been amply demonstrated. On the fiftieth anniversary of his death, the pedagogy of the French educator has been shown to be as relevant as ever.","Rabazas Romero, Teresa Ramos Zamora, Sara Sanz Simon, Carlos",,"Romero, TR Zamora, SR Simón, CS",589,"[Rabazas Romero, Teresa; Ramos Zamora, Sara; Sanz Simon, Carlos] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Educ Studies, Madrid, Spain.",Complutense University of Madrid,,,,,2025-01-19,Freinet pedagogy; teaching innovation; university; History of Education,10.1080/00309230.2018.1556308,Article,,1477-674X,rabarom@ucm.es; sramosz@ucm.es; csa02@ucm.es,607,,Complutense University of Madrid; Banco Santander,"This article was written, in part, thanks to the grant of a pre-doctoral contract for the training of researchers, financed by the Complutense University of Madrid and the Banco Santander.",1X0SF,,4,PAEDAGOG HIST,Paedagog.

"The paper offers a case study of two bilingual girls aged 10, born in London, of Albanian-speaking families who arrived in the UK as refugees. An earlier study, when the girls were aged six, explored the strategies they used as they learned to read with their mothers in Albanian using dual language books. Four years on, supported by a primary school in East London that values the bilingualism of its pupils, the girls have become authors. Based on observation, recordings and transcription, the present study follows them as they create their own dual language book: composing a joint story in English and translating it into Albanian. Through an analysis of transcripts and observations, the paper explores how the girls face the challenges of translation. Working together in school, without a dictionary, the girls use their own linguistic resources to negotiate meaning and to achieve the close translation that they know is expected in a dual language text. In the process, they reveal to the researcher their understanding of how their languages work. In a reflection on their journey towards biliteracy, they acknowledge the important role played by their teachers in encouraging their bilingual development and reveal their pride in becoming authors.","Sneddon, Raymonde",,"Sneddon, R",435,"Univ E London, Sir John Cass Sch Educ, London E15 4LZ, England.",University of East London,,,,,2025-01-19,bilingualism; dual language; literacy; primary school education; EAL,10.1080/09500782.2012.656650,Article,,1747-7581,raymonde.sneddon@zen.co.uk,450,,,,995SW,,5,LANG EDUC-UK,Lang.

"Compulsory secondary education is constituted as a stage of high risk or academic vulnerability for the immigrant population. This multiple case study examines difficulties and opportunities faced by seventeen immigrant schoolchildren in compulsory schooling education cycles as elucidated by the evaluative resources they employ as they construct a narrative discourse shaped by academic-professional transitions and expectations. Specifically, we focus on the semantic-discursive component of attitude, analysing its three levels of appraisal: affect, judgement, and appreciation. We conducted in-depth interviews with immigrants attending public high school in Chile and a collective participatory methodology, both of a biographical-narrative nature. The findings highlight the influence of various influential factors on student trajectories: the characteristics of the host country, the challenges posed by the pandemic, family support, racism, the role of teachers, and academic-professional aspirations. Regarding the obstacles, racist bullying is identified between the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school, which coincides with the results of the literature reviewed. Regarding opportunities, the influential adult figure represented by parents and teachers is positioned as a decisive protective support in the development and progress of educational transitions. Similarly, the configuration of high academic-professional expectations functions as a predictor of educational success.","Pacheco, Cesar M.

"The concept of environmental citizenship is approached in face of its renewed use in international projects in Latin America and the Caribbean, and also of the formulation of new courses on ethics and. values basic and high school education. The controversies about the concept of citizenship in the light of several theoretical schools are discussed, and a position is assumed which favors its application in educational proposals. The concept is linked to that of daily life in order to show that the practice of citizenship should permeate the different public and private life spaces. The last part describes how the current discussion about citizen education presents certain features that are similar to the genealogy of the environmental education concept, and it is maintained that education for the environmental citizenship implies a social pedagogy, which proposes to develop abilities to live in a way that implies the deliberate capacity to know how to choose among several options, stemming from ethical considerations and community interests, that is, political ones. This sets the bases for building a public life based on social forms sustained by a critical exercise of citizenship in the framework of an environmental and cultural policy, mostly in front of the challenges faced by consumption and individualism praised by the globalizing neoliberal development style in which we are immersed.","Gaudiano, EG",,"Gaudiano, EG",611,,,,,,,2025-01-19,,,Article,,,,615,,,,738LM,,10,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,Spanish,,20,,,"APARTADO 51842, CARACAS 1050A, VENEZUELA",OCT,5,CARACAS,,,J,INTERCIENCIA,2003,"Gaudiano, Edgar/G-2285-2015","Gaudiano, EG (corresponding author), Insurgeates Sur 1685,Piso 10, Mexico City 01020, DF, Mexico.",Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,0378-1844,INTERCIENCIA,,,4,Education for the environmental citizenship,0,4,WOS:000186289200009,28,,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),4
"Re-enactment is a highly popular mode of public history, not only amongst hobbyists, but also in museums, official festivals, documentaries, movies and even school education programmes. It is also emerging in numerous academic fields as a salient (albeit problematic) topic of analysis. Particularly amongst historians, however, it remains on the fringe, held at arm's length, the charismatic, but troubled (and troubling) distant relative. This article questions some of the academic preconceptions regarding re-enactment, reinterpreting the participatory, embodied aspects of the practice as areas of significant potential. I do so by first briefly examining the (potentially productive) tensions between archival, academic history and other modes of historical inquiry, considering what traditions of the discipline may be affecting our attitudes towards other, less ""scholarly"" modes. The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of academia encourages us to utilise other theoretical and methodological approaches in this endeavour. Bringing historiography, anthropology, philosophy and performance studies theory into communication, I then examine the Jane Austen Festival Australia as an ethnographic case study. In so doing, I assess the potential of re-enactment as an embodied, performative methodology; one that challenges us to readdress what we consider to be history - and who we acknowledge as historians.","Johnson, Katherine M.",,"Johnson, KM",193,"Univ Sydney, Dept Performance Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",University of Sydney,,,,,2025-01-19,historiography; Jane Austen; living history; affective history; dance; experiential; somatic; embodied culture; re-enactment,10.1080/13642529.2014.973709,Article,,1470-1154,kjoh9815@uni.sydney.edu.a,206,,,,CC4CV,SHIP,2,RETHINK HIST,Rethink.

After data collection and organization in field notes, content analysis was used, based on the steps suggested by Bardin (2016): pre-analysis; scanning of the material; treatment of results, inference and interpretation. Two focuses of study analysis emerged based on the frequency indicators: the teachers' statements for the search for continuing education and teachers' learning expectations. The teachers' statements for the search for continuing education were chosen for the reflections of this article, which indicate the improvement of educational practice, new knowledge and the permanence or rise in the labor market. The teachers indicate love and dream as specific references for teaching in prison classrooms; these, shared in the formative meetings, enhance the commitment and engagement to carry on, despite the objective and subjective challenges and conditions of work, with the teaching activity with people momentarily removed from social life.","da Silva Moraes, Luciana Ferreira Cammarosano Onofre, Elenice Maria",,"Moraes, LFD Onofre, EMC",,"[da Silva Moraes, Luciana Ferreira] Secretaria Estado Educ Mato Grosso, Cuiaba, Mato Grosso, Brazil.

"Objectives To examine whether medical savings accounts in China have achieved the intended goal of promoting individual savings for medical care. Method Longitudinal data were obtained from one of the first Chinese cities that implemented medical savings accounts. The sample includes 246,681 enrolees with participation of at least 10 years by the end of 2010. We conducted descriptive analyses of medical savings account balances and a series of multivariate logistic analyses of risk factors for having low medical savings account accumulation. Results Medical savings account accumulation was low, with 41% of the enrolees having a balance below the average cost per outpatient visit, and the proportion increased to 54% and 58% when the deductible for inpatient care at secondary and tertiary hospitals was used as the threshold, respectively. Factors associated with having low medical savings account accumulation include female, old age, below high school education, retired and having a lower salary. Conclusion Medical savings accounts have not achieved the intended goal of encouraging personal savings for medical care. Given the low medical savings account accumulation, China's decision-makers need to adjust policies, especially during the current healthcare reform.","Yu, Hao Chen, Jiaying",,"Yu, H Chen, JY",155,"[Yu, Hao] RAND Corp, 4570 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.

"Decreased funding for middle and high school education has resulted in reduced classroom time, which, when coupled with an increased focus on standardized testing, has decreased the exposure of many middle school students to hands-on science education. To help address these challenges, we developed an integrated outreach program, spanning grades 6-12, designed to engage students by bringing students to the University of Oregon to perform hands-on laboratory experiments. Initially developed to supplement science education lost to state-mandated furlough days, the programmatic design can be applied readily in other contexts including afterschool, weekend, or summer programs. The outreach activities and scaffolding rely heavily on near-peer mentoring; which provides a visible pathway for younger students to envision themselves as future scientists while also providing mentoring and leadership opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The use of near-peer mentoring is also critically important for the program's sustainability because it enables a more efficient allocation of graduate student and faculty time. In the first 2.5 years, over 450 middle school students have participated in the program and student feedback shows that students are engaged and excited about the outreach activities.","Pluth, Michael D.

"While issues of (in)justice in K12 STEM learning have garnered increasing attention, limited research has attended to learning as social-spatial transformation. We draw upon a justice-oriented framework of equitably consequential learning to call attention to how learning and engagement in K12 STEM is rooted in the history and geographies of young people's lives. Without attention to the ways in which learning is an historicized and sociopolitical activity, efforts to address seemingly intractable equity challenges in K12 STEM education across the intersections of racial and class inequality will remain elusive. Using data from middle school classroom studies focused on engineering for sustainable communities, where community ethnography is central to engineering design, we investigate the social-spatial relationalities that minoritized youth bring to engineering design, and how relationalities may support youth in transforming oppressive knowledge and power structures toward equitably consequential learning. Findings reveal that organizing learning engineering design around youths' rich everyday experiences and community wisdom through community ethnography, addressed hyperlocal, sociopolitical community challenges. As a result, the social-spatial terrain upon which subject-object relations are enacted shifted, expanding the discourses, practices and outcomes of middle school engineering design that were legitimized. Making present this power-mediated terrain makes visible the often hidden, but ever present, unjust school-based relationalities, enabling them to be re-mediated in justice-oriented ways. Paying attention to social-spatial relationalities reveal (1) the multiple scales of activity, (2) inter-scalar mobilities and interactions, and (3) possible resultant impacts of such interactions that further affect activity at each scale. We discuss implications for how theories of equitably consequential learning can be advanced through the frame of social-spatial justice.","Tan, Edna Barton, Angela Calabrese Nazar, Christina Restrepo",,"Tan, EN Barton, AC Nazar, CR",94,"[Tan, Edna] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Teacher Educ & Higher Educ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.

"Robotic competitions are an excellent way to promote innovative solutions for the current industries' challenges and entrepreneurial spirit, acquire technical and transversal skills through active teaching, and promote this area to the public. In other words, since robotics is a multidisciplinary field, its competitions address several knowledge topics, especially in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) category, that are shared among the students and researchers, driving further technology and science. A new competition encompassed in the Portuguese Robotics Open was created according to the Industry 4.0 concept in the production chain. In this competition, RobotAtFactory 4.0, a shop floor, is used to mimic a fully automated industrial logistics warehouse and the challenges it brings. Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) must be used to operate without supervision and perform the tasks that the warehouse requests. There are different types of boxes which dictate their partial and definitive destinations. In this reasoning, AMRs should identify each and transport them to their destinations. This paper describes an approach to the indoor localization system for the competition based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and ArUco markers. Different innovation methods for the obtained observations were tested and compared in the EKF. A real robot was designed and assembled to act as a test bed for the localization system's validation. Thus, the approach was validated in the real scenario using a factory floor with the official specifications provided by the competition organization.","Braun, Joao Junior, Alexandre O.

"Educators have suggested that citizens need the ability to engage in self-directed inquiry and problem solving. In line with the trend, current reforms in Taiwanese schools advocate the development of these core competencies. One way to achieve this goal is through STEM education. STEM modules which integrate science, math, technology, and engineering have become a prime catalyst for inquiry-based multidisciplinary teaching and learning. Although the demands and the benefits of STEM modules are often highlighted, the challenges of the development and implementation of such an interdisciplinary module are less discussed. This paper describes the process of the development of a bio-sensor module that uses Arduino to analyze glucose level of concentration. This multidisciplinary module integrates physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, electronics, and programming. The goal of the program is for students to construct a device that imitates a commercial glucose meter. Teacher workshops were conducted for educators to learn the concepts and the procedures. A set of questionnaires collected from 21 workshop participants revealed that teachers face various challenges in the process of understanding and modifying the STEM module, as well as preparing students so they are ready to learn with the module. A group interview after the workshop revealed the teachers' difficulties in implementing a module that requires advanced technical skills and materials. The potential usefulness for the students, and the emergence of a different goal than the original plan, provide challenging and enlightening lessons. Rather than an engineering-centered model, this study proposes an alternative science-centered model for STEM material development.","Hsu, Shihkuan Sung, Chia-Chi Sheen, Horn-Jiunn",,"Hsu, SK Sung, CC Sheen, HJ",230,"[Hsu, Shihkuan; Sung, Chia-Chi; Sheen, Horn-Jiunn] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",National Taiwan University,,,,,2025-01-19,models of STEM material development; secondary school; glucose bio-sensor SEM module; teaching science and engineering,10.17323/1814-9545-2020-2-230-251,Article,,,skhsu@ntu.edu.tw; ccsung@ntu.edu.tw; sheenh@ntu.edu.tw,251,,,,MB0FR,PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; ATTITUDES; DESIGN,2,VOPR OBRAZOVANIYA-ED,Vopr.

"Teachers' beliefs such as pedagogical beliefs, self-efficacy, and technology value beliefs are influential to technology integration practice. This study aims to investigate teachers' beliefs and the impact on their 3D printing integration in science classrooms. A total of 26 K-12 teachers across six states in the U.S. participated in a nationally funded project. Teachers' STEM education lesson plans were analyzed to assess their 3D printing and STEM integration levels. Teachers' beliefs were collected through a survey with rating scales adapted from previously validated surveys and several open-ended questions. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate how teacher beliefs were associated with their 3D printing integration. Thematic analysis of the open-ended questions provided a detailed view on teachers' experiences and perceptions, which further explained teachers' beliefs and the impact on their 3D printing integration practice. This study revealed that teachers' pedagogical, self-efficacy, and technology value beliefs were generally not correlated with their 3D printing integration practices except for a negative correlation between teachers' self-efficacy in pedagogical content knowledge and their STEM integration levels. Teachers perceived 3D printing integration as beneficial for students, but they encountered a number of challenges including logistic and technical issues, lack of time and resources, insufficient ability to use 3D printers and connect 3D printing with curriculums, and challenges in teaching students with individual differences. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.","Cheng, Li Antonenko, Pavlo D.

"Citizens of the twenty-first century use specific skills to solve real-life problem situations, propose interdisciplinary solutions, and sustainably solve their communities' socio-scientific and technological problems, locally and globally. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is an integrated and interdisciplinary teaching-learning space. STEM careers are subject to gender gaps in terms of access to higher education, and only a quarter of female students follow a STEM career. Moreover, later in their professional careers, women often obtain lower salaries and income in the STEM professions. STEM education seeks to actively engage students by incorporating technologies into teaching-learning processes since, favoring searching, analysis, solution, and simulation of socio-scientific problems. The latter has become highly visible during the pandemic caused by COVID-19, particularly in emergency remote education measures. Information and communication technologies (ICT) plays a role in online education, either via the knowledge involved in school curricula or an understanding of how the pandemic has evolved. This is a triple task for professors since they must have the right skills to train citizens of the twenty-first century, build new stimulating learning spaces for their highly technologized students, and develop these skills in their students. This article reviews the concepts associated with digital and STEM skills by analyzing a case study, exploring the perception of students in terms of their development of these competencies, and the commitments required in the study plans made by a Professor of Chemistry in a Chilean state university. A mixed investigation was undertaken, considering three phases with different methodologies. The first phase consisted of a bibliographic study, comparing both the digital and STEM skills of several organizations in Chilean education (UNESCO, MINEDUC, and ISTE). ISTE was used as the basis of the applied questionnaire to establish coherence in the dimensions coming from different reference frames. A second phase refers to the analysis of the study plan programs associated with STEM, ICT, and chemistry teaching, through an Analysis Matrix of Aprioristic Categories. In a third phase, the development of digital skills in undergraduate Chemistry students and professors were evaluated through the Digital Competence Questionnaire of Higher Education Students. Based on UNESCO information, the STEM competencies address both the content and its application to problems related to STEM careers in a manner consistent with the training model for science and chemistry teachers. In the case of digital skills, UNESCO integrates international reference frameworks respecting each country's laws, enabling them to adapt them. In Chile, MINEDUC focuses on teachers' use of digital tools to improve the teaching-learning processes of students; and ISTE is focused on the skills of higher education. The analysis of the study programs shows that students' digital skills do not meet the requirements of the Chilean Ministry of Education (MINEDUC). However, the programs enhance more complex cognitive levels when the curricula advance, promoting STEM skills. The digital competence questionnaire for higher education students (CDAES) survey showed a development proportional to the curricular pursuit of the students where, in the first year of the degree, the students declare positive answers in 60.5% of the items consulted. This trend increases in the second and third years (90. 7% of positive answers) and the fourth and fifth years (93.0 and 95.4% of positive answers). It remains a challenge to develop skills to design, create or modify technological educational media that promote the use of digital and STEM skills. In conclusion, this research proposes digital and STEM skills for teacher training, discussing the relevance of their integration in STEM teaching and learning. The teacher training curriculum does not have an explicit association with digital and STEM skills, although it addresses the skills required by national and international benchmarks. However, the students indicate positive attitudes toward the digital skills developed progressively during their training as teachers. As future Chemistry teachers, they value the development of digital teaching skills that allow them to address the challenges that arise in the classroom and thus promote the appreciation of STEM careers, which helps form citizens with more sustainable intentions.","Elias, Michal Perez, Javiera del Rosario Cassot, Montserrat Andres Carrasco, Eduardo Tomljenovic, Marijana Ariadne Zuniga, Elisa",932609,"Elías, M Pérez, J Cassot, MD Carrasco, EA Tomljenovic, M Zúñiga, EA",,"[Elias, Michal; Perez, Javiera; del Rosario Cassot, Montserrat; Tomljenovic, Marijana; Ariadne Zuniga, Elisa] Univ Metropolitana Chile, Fac Ciencias Basicas, Dept Quim, Santiago, Chile.

"This article provides an introduction for the special issue of the Journal of Science Education and Technology focused on computational thinking (CT) from a disciplinary perspective. The special issue connects earlier research on what K-12 students can learn and be able to do using CT with the CT skills and habits of mind needed to productively participate in professional CT-integrated STEM fields. In this context, the phrase ""disciplinary perspective"" simultaneously holds two meanings: it refers to and aims to make connections between established K-12 STEM subject areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and newer CT-integrated disciplines such as computational sciences. The special issue presents a framework for CT integration and includes articles that illuminate what CT looks like from a disciplinary perspective, the challenges inherent in integrating CT into K-12 STEM education, and new ways of measuring CT aligned more closely with disciplinary practices. The aim of this special issue is to offer research-based and practitioner-grounded insights into recent work in CT integration and provoke new ways of thinking about CT integration from researchers, practitioners, and research-practitioner partnerships.","Lee, Irene Grover, Shuchi Martin, Fred Pillai, Sarita Malyn-Smith, Joyce",,"Lee, I Grover, S Martin, F Pillai, S Malyn-Smith, J",1,"[Lee, Irene] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.

"Introduction: College students often encounter challenges or ambiguity in online learning, which they cannot overcome independently, and therefore, require help. However, relatively little is known about how academic help-seeking can be supported in online contexts and about its potential benefits. The present study investigated the role of academic help-seeking in online STEM learning and its contextual antecedents. Methods: A total of 213 college students, enrolled in an introductory Engineering course, completed an online survey. Their survey responses and academic record data were analyzed. Results: Results of path analysis indicated that adaptive help-seeking was positively related to retention intention, whereas expedient help-seeking was negatively related to the choice of future courses. In addition, avoidant help-seeking was negatively related to retention intention and major declaration status and positively to disorganized studying. Results also showed that sense of belonging and environmental fixed mindset served as significant predictors of academic help-seeking. Discussion: Findings indicate that academic help-seeking is related to successful online STEM learning. Therefore, fostering online learning contexts in which students perceive more sense of belonging and less environmental fixed mindset is crucial.","Won, Sungjun Chang, Yujin",1438299,"Won, S Chang, Y",,"[Won, Sungjun] Gongju Natl Univ Educ, Dept Educ, Gongju, South Korea.

"Interdisciplinary training is fundamental for the development of Competencies in Environmental Education that contribute to the sustainability of the planet. Moreover, in the case of academic improvement in STEM areas and Social Sciences. In this sense, the research question is what are the learning results in the Competencies in Environmental Education of high-performance students from STEM and Social Sciences areas from a training experience developed in the B-Learning modality? The objective of the study is to diagnose these learning outcomes after carrying out the training experience. The empirical method of quantitative approach uses the multivariate statistics of Logistic Regression with respect to the profile variables and learning outcomes in a census sample of 71 graduates of the implemented training experience. The findings of the study show the learning achievement of these students, being relevant their advances in the knowledge of the process of environmental control and environmental public policies. In this way, a basis is ensured for the implementation of competencies in environmental education through research projects that are replicable in the various contexts of professional development and at the local level.","Hurtado Magan, Giovana Medina Zuta, Patricia",,"Magán, GH Zuta, PM",243,"[Hurtado Magan, Giovana; Medina Zuta, Patricia] Univ San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru.",Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola,,,,,2025-01-19,Environmental education competency; STEM education; education for environmental enforcement; education in high potential students,,Article,,,giovana.hurtado@epg.usil.pe; patricia.medina@epg.usil.pe,252,,,,0C8WV,HUMAN-RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT; CHALLENGES,84,REV CONRADO,REV.

"Even with increasing calls for both researchers and educators to attend to the ""E"" in STEM from within the larger field of STEM education, little is known about the practices that serve to support early educators' pedagogy and related content knowledge of engineering design. Using multiple methods in a revelatory, embedded, single-case design, this research provides an explanatory account of preservice teachers (PTs) engagement during a structured field experience with preschoolers designed to foster their understanding of design-based engineering though collaborative learning and teaching experiences. Research Findings: Findings reveal that the PTs developed more robust understandings of design-based engineering and stronger self-efficacy beliefs related to their practice following participation in the learning and teaching collaborative project. PTs also voiced concerns over perceived challenges of integrating engineering instruction within the pedagogically and content restrictive environments of contemporary early childhood classrooms. Practice or Policy: Additionally, this research suggests that guided teaching and learning partnerships can support early childhood teacher preparation programs in developing preservice teachers' understandings of the interrelationships between engineering and other aspects of the curriculum using emergent curricular approaches and interactional, play-based pedagogies.","Eckhoff, Angela",,"Eckhoff, A",118,"[Eckhoff, Angela] Old Dominion Univ, Darden Coll Educ & Profess Studies, Dept Teaching & Learning, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",Old Dominion University,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1080/10901027.2021.2015492,Article,DEC 2021,1745-5642,aeckhoff@odu.edu,142,,,,9K6CE,GUIDED PLAY; SCIENCE; BELIEFS; CLASSROOM; AGENCY; CURRICULUM; KNOWLEDGE; IDENTITY; DESIGN; NOVICE,1,J EARLY CHILD TEACH,J.

"Increasingly, student work is being conducted on computers and online, producing vast amounts of learning-related data. The educational analytics fields have produced many insights about learning based solely on tutoring systems' automatically logged data, or ""log data."" But log data leave out important contextual information about the learning experience. For example, a student working at a computer might be working independently with few outside influences. Alternatively, he or she might be in a lively classroom, with other students around, talking and offering suggestions. Tools that capture these other experiences have potential to augment and complement log data. However, the collection of rich, multimodal data streams and the increased complexity and heterogeneity in the resulting data pose many challenges to researchers. Here, we present two empirical studies that take advantage of multimodal data sources to enrich our understanding of student learning. We leverage and extend quantitative models of student learning to incorporate insights derived jointly from data collected in multiple modalities (log data, video, and high-fidelity audio) and contexts (individual vs. collaborative classroom learning). We discuss the unique benefits of multimodal data and present methods that take advantage of such benefits while easing the burden on researchers' time and effort.","Liu, Ran Stamper, John Davenport, Jodi Crossley, Scott McNamara, Danielle Nzinga, Kalonji Sherin, Bruce",,"Liu, R Stamper, J Davenport, J Crossley, S McNamara, D Nzinga, K Sherin, B",99,"[Liu, Ran; Stamper, John] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Human Comp Interact Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.

"The presented research focused on developing and testing an innovative interdisciplinary STEM didactic model. The developed didactic model was introduced in the field of eco-farming. To the participants, it offers the possibility for non-formal training, which can take place anywhere and anytime. Participants require some knowledge of STEM subjects (especially chemistry and biology) as well as knowledge of ecology, technology, and engineering, in order to provide answers and solutions to environmental challenges while using knowledge of mathematics (especially combinatorics and statistics) to search for optimal solutions (in our case, a lean business plan). The model was tested in non-formal education settings, based on an interdisciplinary approach and modern technologies, such as monitoring the effectiveness of training using electroencephalography (EEG) and mobile applications. In the presented didactic model, special emphasis was placed on an interdisciplinary STEM approach to environmental protection, ecology, connatural forms of production and sustainable development. The presented research confirms the hypotheses that non-formal education is becoming an increasingly important form of education and training, and that the use of the interdisciplinary didactic model, contemporary technologies, and mobile applications, increases the time and intensity of concentration in learning and thus improves learning effectiveness.","Pajk, Tine Van Isacker, Karel Abersek, Boris Flogie, Andrej",,"Pajk, T Van Isacker, K Abersek, B Flogie, A",277,"[Pajk, Tine] Primary Sch Muta, Solska Ulica 6, Muta 2366, Slovenia.

"Although many challenges of the 21st century need solutions which are directly connected with the development of new technologies, the preferences of prospective students in Germany are often far from mathematics, physics and chemistry. Moreover, the acceptance and recognition of new achievements in these disciplines are quite low in society, even if these achievements are the basis for the development of new technologies that positively affect daily life. As a part of a campaign intended to increase the number of students in the fields of materials science and materials technology (and related fields), the authors created an escape room focused on materials science and crystallography, which illustrates the approaches used by materials scientists and the beauty of crystallography. The fundamental features of the escape room, which are presented in this contribution, are its variability and the ability to inspire participants who have different backgrounds in physics, chemistry and/or materials science. By varying the level of difficulty and the game play duration, the escape room structure makes it possible to appeal to a broad audience, offer an authentic escape room experience and impart lasting knowledge through reflection after completion. The authors' experiences with the escape room and the feedback from the attendees are summarized at the end of the contribution.","Schimpf, Christian Lachmann, Jonas Wetzel, Marius H.

"Alginate hydrogel beads are a common platform for generating 3D cell cultures in biomedical research. Simple methods for bead generation using a manual pipettor or syringe are low-throughput and produce beads showing high variability in size and shape. To address these challenges, we designed a 3D printed bead generator that uses an airflow to cleave beads from a stream of hydrogel solution. The performance of the proposed alginate bead generator was evaluated by changing the volume flow rates of alginate (Q(Alg)) and air (Q(A)), the diameter of device nozzle (d) and the concentration of alginate gel solution (C). We identified that the diameter of beads (D = 0.9 -2.8 mm) can be precisely controlled by changing Q(A) and d. Also the bead generation frequency (f) can be tuned by changing Q(Alg). Finally, we demonstrated that viability and biological function (pericellular matrix deposition) of chondrocytes were not adversely affected by high f using this bead generator. Because 3D printing is becoming a more accessible technique, our unique design will allow greater access to average biomedical research laboratories, STEM education and industries in cost- and time-effective manner.","Lee, Donghee Greer, Sydney E.

"The purpose of this study was to investigate the scope and depth of the engineering design process understood by Cambodian engineering students. An activity involving the building of a mobile phone battery charger system was designed and implemented for the study. Ten undergraduate engineering students participated, and data were collected from focus group interviews, photocopies of protocols and initial products, and observation notes throughout a three-week long project. Data were analyzed by coding and finding patterns and themes in major storylines focusing on the engineering design process. The results were fourfold: (a) Cambodian undergraduate engineering students expanded their understanding of engineering design benefits from an individual to a national level; (b) students felt they were not adequately prepared in mathematics and science in high school; (c) the learning environment, that is, the problem-based context, and the culture of the Cambodian classroom influenced students' learning in engineering design; and (d) students also recognized the iterative nature of the engineering design process and associated challenges to overcome. Thus, experiencing engineering design in a practical, engineering problem-based context helped strengthen their career goal of becoming engineers. The implications for engineering education in Cambodia are discussed in the paper.","Park, Do-Yong Bae, Dae Hwan",,"Park, DY Bae, DH",66,"[Park, Do-Yong] Illinois State Univ, Coll Educ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.

"In chemistry, women are still underrepresented in the postbaccalaureate stages. However, there has been limited discussion in STEM education that treats chemistry as a singular discipline and explores doctoral students' experiences from a mentoring perspective. This qualitative research study investigated how contextual factors (i.e., social barriers and social support) and personal factors (i.e., being a female student) influence students' motivation and career goals in chemistry based on the Social Cognitive Career Theory, with an emphasis on mentoring experience as one of the contextual factors. Fourteen women doctoral students were interviewed. The findings revealed that women students rarely planned to stay in academia because of the barriers they experienced, such as the overwork norm. Women students faced microaggressions, such as others questioning their ability, a lack of sense of belonging, and unequal involvement in administration work. Mentoring support as a format of social support can mitigate these challenges. However, students' needs were nuanced depending on their developmental stages. The study concludes with nine action items for faculty members to support women students' success in chemistry, providing valuable information for future policy and mentoring training program designs.","Zhang, Qiyue",,"Zhang, QY",319,"[Zhang, Qiyue] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Educ Psychol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,,,,,2025-01-19,graduate education; qualitative research; womenin chemistry; mentoring; chemistry education,10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00197,Article,JAN 2024,1938-1328,qiyue.zhang@tamu.edu,327,,"Texas A and M University; Graduate Research Grant by the School of Education and Human Development, Texas AM University","The author would like to acknowledge the support of the Graduate Research Grant by the School of Education and Human Development, Texas A&M University.

"In the 2017/2018 academic year, the government of Ghana, through the Ministry of Education, began an educational reform policy codenamed the ""Free Senior High School"" (FSHS) policy to fully absorb the cost, increase enrolment, and improve the quality of education for all public senior high schools in Ghana. To accommodate more students and reduce overcrowding in schools, the government, as part of the FSHS policy, introduced the double-track system, which divides the total student population and staff into two tracks; as one of the tracks attends school, the other is on vacation and vice versa. No study has assessed this policy on education outcomes. This study assessed the impact of the FSHS policy and the double-track system on quality education outcomes and explored the challenges associated with the implementation of the policies. The study further identified strategies needed to address these challenges. The study employed a quasi-experimental study design using a pre-post data collection instrument designed to assess quality education metrics. We also used a comparative cross-sectional study design and qualitative design methodologies to evaluate the FSHS policy and the double-track system. We quantified the impact of the policies using quantile and ordinary least square regression models with cluster robust standard errors. Our evaluation of the policy showed a significant decline in quality of education outcomes and academic performance. Students who attended the double-track schools performed poorly in all the core subjects compared with non-double-track schools. The challenges associated with the implementation of the policy were financial constraints, infrastructure deficit, inadequate and delayed release of food items, lack of teaching and learning materials, inadequate contact hours, and poor implementation of the policy and the double-track system.

"Purpose This two-year study illuminates the experiences of technology coaches (digital learning coaches [DL] and science technology engineering and mathematics/literacy coaches [STEM/L]) as they engaged in their own professional learning (PL) facilitated by a faculty researcher.Design/methodology/approach Technology coaches from different school districts and their respective colleagues participated in book studies as part of their PL. They reflected and debriefed individually and collaboratively with a researcher facilitator. Data were collected through interviews, field notes at meetings, observations, researchers' reflections and artefacts. Qualitative data analysis methods were employed.Findings The findings offer a glimpse into (1) benefits of cross-district collaboration, (2) challenges finding resources for coaching, (3) career-long desire to learn and (4) time to build and sustain cross-collaborations.Practical implications Conclusions suggest that DL and STEM/L coaches benefit from their own dedicated, differentiated programme of PL supported by each other (as from other districts) and a researcher facilitator. Educational implications are offered for researchers and other school district stakeholders for consideration for them to foster coaches' collaborative PL.Originality/value Importantly, this project is an exemplar of how to support coaches' PL and growth through researcher facilitation of cross-district collaborative learning.","Gallagher, Tiffany L.

"The Principals as STEM Leaders (PASL) project was an Australian Government-funded national research and professional learning programme for principals, aimed at building STEM leadership capacity. The project involved cluster-based delivery of six learning modules and generation of case studies outlining schools' different approaches to STEM education and STEM leadership. This article analyses factors contributing to the development of four contrasting schools' STEM profiles, identifying the unique approaches and leadership strategies each adopted in designing STEM curriculum for meeting the learning needs of their diverse students. It positions these schools' endeavours within the broader PASL professional learning programme, adding to the limited body of empirical work detailing different approaches schools take to the ""STEM challenge,"" which, for most, presents a disruptive innovation to traditional curriculum and structures. The vital role of school leaders in communicating a clear, evidence-based vision for STEM and also ""walking the talk"" and being highly engaged in STEM programmes, was a common feature across the cases. This built relational trust, and a strong whole-of-school commitment to and understanding of STEM, to some extent mitigating the challenges of rigid curriculum and external assessment requirements. The study highlights the complex interaction of professional learning, leadership, curriculum design, pedagogy, and school culture in establishing innovative STEM programmes in schools.","Falloon, Garry Stevenson, Michael Beswick, Kim Fraser, Sharon Geiger, Vincent",,"Falloon, G Stevenson, M Beswick, K Fraser, S Geiger, V",110,"[Falloon, Garry; Stevenson, Michael] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

"The engineering design process (EDP) is one tool teachers can use to facilitate STEM integration. As part of a larger three-year longitudinal research project regarding engineering identity development among middle school youth in a summer robotics outreach program, this study aims to understand teachers' willingness to incorporate engineering design in their classrooms through an exploration of their perceptions of the EDP, its applications to their subject matter and classroom context, methods of enacting the EDP, and perceived challenges to and supports for doing so. We conducted a qualitative case study and drew our results from focus groups and semi -structured interviews with eight teacher participants. Participants were successful in describing the EDP and its cyclical nature. However, classroom enactment of the EDP was predominantly indirect and often used to solve non -subject -specific classroom problems. Direct enactment was limited to projects already part of the existing curriculum. Issues with instructional resources, lesson planning, time, and student background were the EDP enactment barriers most frequently noted, while supports described were all responses to the identified barriers. The EDP offers a promising way to integrate engineering with math and science. However, additional support is needed for more meaningful classroom enactment of the EDP.","Vomvoridi-Ivanovic, Eugenia Lane, Tonisha B. Cain, Leia K.

"Bibliometric mapping serves as a method to systematically evaluate and visually demonstrate the development of a research field. CiteSpace and VOSviewer, two research tools of bibliometric mapping, were used in the present study to analyze, synthesize, and visualize the hot topics as well as frontier evolution of science education. Co-authorship analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, cluster analysis, and content analysis were conducted based on 6278 articles selected from seven SSCI journals. Researchers from countries/territories in North America, Europe, Oceania, and West and East Asia had maintained relatively tighter cooperation with each other. Highly influential literature mainly focused on the standards, methods, practice, and reflection of science education. In the past two decades, the literature on science education covered seven hot topics: conceptual issues in science education, gender, scientific argumentation, professional development, science learning, evolution, and peer review. The research on science education in the past 20 years can be divided into three phases: the first stage focused on knowledge learning, identity, and informal education; the second stage emphasized formal education, scientific literacy, and social-science issues; and the third stage highlighted scientific argumentation and STEM education.","Wang, Shutao Chen, Yaoyao Lv, Xinlei Xu, Jianmei",,"Wang, ST Chen, YY Lv, XL Xu, JM",845,"[Wang, Shutao; Chen, Yaoyao; Lv, Xinlei] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Educ, Hangzhou 320058, Peoples R China.

"The COVID-19 global pandemic presented unprecedented challenges to K-16 educators, including the closing of educational agencies and the abrupt transition to online teaching and learning. Educators sought to adapt in-person learning activities to teach in remote and hybrid online settings. This study explores how a partnership between middle and high school teachers in an urban school district and undergraduate STEM mentors of color leveraged digital tools and collaborative pedagogies to teach science, technology, and engineering during a global pandemic. We used a qualitative multi-case study to describe three cases of teachers and undergraduate mentors. We then offer a cross-case analysis to interpret the diverse ways in which partners used technologies, pedagogy, and content to promote equitable outcomes for students, both in remote and hybrid settings. We found that the partnership and technologies led to rigorous and connected learning for students. Teachers and undergraduates carefully scaffolded technology use and content applications while providing ongoing opportunities for students to receive feedback and reflect on their learning. Findings provide implications for community partnerships and digital tools to promote collaborative and culturally relevant STEM learning opportunities in the post-pandemic era.","Kier, Meredith Weaver Johnson, Lindy L.",48,"Kier, MW Johnson, LL",,"[Kier, Meredith Weaver; Johnson, Lindy L.] William & Mary, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",,,,,,2025-01-19,collaborative technologies; community partnerships; STEM education; COVID-19; middle school; high school; culturally relevant pedagogies,10.3390/educsci12010048,Article,,2227-7102,mwkier@wm.edu; lljohnson@wm.edu,,,Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (2019-2022) from the National Science Foundation [1932739]; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Research On Learning [1932739] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,This research was funded by an Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (2019-2022) from the National Science Foundation (Award #1932739).

"Ghana is a significant cattle producer in Africa with an estimated cattle population of 3 million in 2020 [1]. The role of transporters in linking farms to markets and slaughterhouses is crucial in the livestock value chain. However, cattle transportation subjects the animals to high levels of stress, compromising their welfare, and transporters face challenges such as long working hours and harsh conditions. The objective of this study was to explore current practices, indigenous knowledge, and operational risks pertaining to animal welfare among transporters. The study was conducted in five regions connected by the N16, N10, and N6 Highway, the primary route for cattle transportation from the Ghana -Burkina Faso border to the coastal capital of Accra. A total of 78 transporters participated in the study. Out of the 78 participants in this study, the majority of transporters were young adults (56.5%) with secondary school education (45.9%) and 0 -5 years of experience (37.2%). The average distance and time for transporting cattle was 528 km and 18 h, respectively. The transporters highlighted significant challenges encountered during cattle transport, including feed and water shortage, particularly prominent during the dry season (32.1%), as well as the occurrence of diseases and mortality, particularly high during the rainy season (41%). Furthermore, vehicular breakdowns were a common issue reported by transporters, with a substantial majority (88.5%) experiencing breakdowns during their last 10 trips. The results showed that most transporters (84.7%) had limited knowledge of animal welfare and had not received any formal education on livestock transportation. Instead, they gained experience as assistants on other trucks before becoming drivers. The findings of this study highlight the need for improved welfare standards for cattle during transportation and formal training programs for transporters in animal welfare and livestock transportation.","Mogre, J.

"In the light of the challenges due to COVID-19, this study proposes an innovative teaching model to integrate STEM education (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and virtual reality (VR) into Maker education. Experimental research was conducted with three groups (two experimental groups and a control group) to explore (a) the impact of the introduction of STEM in Maker knowledge learning effectiveness, Maker self-efficacy, and Maker works; (b) the effect of introducing VR on the recognition of Makerspace; and (c) the effect of Maker courses on the development of Maker skills. The results show that the proposed Maker course improves students' Maker self-efficacy, and that STEM-based instruction has a significant impact on learning effectiveness. However, according to the profile evaluations, the STEM-oriented group's Maker works were more complicated and systematic than that of experiment group 1. Moreover, the VR groups (groups 1 and 2) were more familiar with Makerspace than was the PPT group (the control group). Therefore, the findings indicate that when Makerspace is introduced, VR content is a more effective teaching method than PowerPoint slides. Second, the Maker curriculum improves students' Maker self-efficacy. Specifically, STEM-oriented instruction improves students' Maker knowledge, complexity, and completion of Maker works.","Shu, Yu Huang, Tien-Chi",,"Shu, Y Huang, TC",108,"[Shu, Yu] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Gen Educ, Taichung, Taiwan.

"The purpose of this study was to determine the influence that a novel, industry-situated, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Learning Laboratory (STEM Lab) experience may have on students' (ages 10-18) perceptions of manufacturing-related careers as well as to identify any challenges/strategies for the implementation of these informal learning spaces within manufacturing facilities. STEM labs, which are similar to makerspaces, can be defined as physical spaces where students can learn integrated skills and content through hands-on experiences (Roy and Love, 2017). While STEM labs can be found in a variety of settings (e.g., school libraries, museums, or even theme parks), the industry-situated STEM lab that is the focus of this study is a unique application of such a learning environment in an informal space within a manufacturing facility. However, the aim for this specific space is to offer local students an opportunity to see manufacturing, the people that work there, and the skills that might be necessary to pursue a future career in the various aspects of this industry. This type of career awareness and preparation initiative has become an area of interest for manufacturers as they continue to face increasing challenges with attracting employees and confronting negative, potentially outdated, perceptions of manufacturing-related careers. That being said, this research will not attempt to justify the STEM lab initiative, but will instead provide a critical view of this novel context and this type of informal learning environment. This research objective was pursued by interviewing key industry stakeholders and analyzing an existing dataset-consisting of both student surveys and drawing tests-collected by the host manufacturer over the first year of the lab's operation. By triangulating the data gathered from stakeholder interviews and both student surveys and drawing tests, which were collected before and after their experience with the STEM lab at the manufacturing facilities, this research sheds light on the challenges that similar industry-situated learning environments might face, as well as provides opportunities to potentially enhance the experience from both the student and industry perspective.","Walls, William H.

"Background: Due to the rising demands for a Canadian workforce with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)-related education, there is a need to increase youth engagement in STEM education and programming. Research, however, has shown that youth residing in low-income communities are disproportionately affected by psychosocial barriers, which often inhibit meaningful engagement in STEM programming. Visions of Science Network for Learning (VoSNL) was designed and implemented to address these existing barriers. VoSNL is a charitable organization in Southern Ontario, Canada, that provides weekly community-based STEM programming to low-income and marginalized youth during out-of-school time. VoSNL programming is delivered directly within the community and is free-of-charge for all youth in order to minimize barriers of physical and financial accessibility. The purpose of this report was to provide a detailed description of a core program within VoSNL-Community Science Clubs-and summarize the findings of a process evaluation, specifically the successes and challenges of implementing a community-based, out-of-school STEM program. Results: Program successes are outlined along with the challenges that have been identified through program implementation. Successes include (a) delivering the program within a community context, (b) opportunities for consistent engagement, and (c) establishing positive youth-staff relationships. Challenges include (a) navigating community-based issues, (b) conducting outreach and promotion, and (c) accommodating a wide age range of youth. Further, lessons learned from an evaluation of program implementation are also discussed. Conclusions: This report provides one of the first program descriptions and process evaluations of a community-based, youth-focused STEM program within a Canadian context. The findings in this report have helped to improve the delivery and evaluation of the VoSNL program and may act as a catalyst for program expansion to reach more youth in marginalized communities. Further, the findings can also provide a strong framework for programmers interested in implementing STEM youth programming in a community context, assist in the replication of similar models in other locations, and enhance STEM learning amongst youth.","Duodu, Eugenia Noble, Jessica Yusuf, Yusuf Garay, Camilo Bean, Corliss",20,"Duodu, E Noble, J Yusuf, Y Garay, C Bean, C",,"[Noble, Jessica; Bean, Corliss] Youth Res & Evaluat eXchange, Toronto, ON, Canada.

"This paper focuses on the development, delivery and preliminary impact analysis of an engineering Work Experience Week (WEW) programme for KS4 students in the School of Civil, Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering (CAME) at the University of Bristol, UK. Key stage 4, is the legal term for the two years of school education which incorporate GCSEs in England, age 15-16. The programme aims to promote the engineering profession among secondary school pupils. During the WEW, participants worked as engineering researchers: working in teams, they had to tackle a challenging engineering design problem. The experience included hands-on activities and the use of state-of-the-art rapid prototyping and advanced testing equipment. The students were supervised by a group of team leaders, a diverse group of undergraduate and postgraduate engineering students, technical staff, and academics at the School of CAME. The vision of the WEW programme is to transmit the message that everybody can be an engineer, that there are plenty of different routes into engineering that can be taken depending on pupils' strengths and interests and that there are a vast amount of different engineering careers and challenges to be tackled by the engineers of the future. Feedback from the participants in the scheme has been overwhelmingly positive.","Gonzalez-Buelga, A. Renaud-Assemat, I Selwyn, B. Ross, J.

"Countries across Africa continue to face major challenges in education. In this review, we examine 145 recent empirical studies (from 2014 onward) on how to increase access to and improve the quality of education across the continent, specifically examining how these studies update previous research findings. We find that 64% of the studies evaluate government-implemented programs, 36% include detailed cost analysis and 35% evaluate multiple treatment arms. We identify several areas where new studies provide rigorous evidence on topics that do not figure prominently in earlier evidence syntheses. New evidence shows promising impacts of structured pedagogy interventions (which typically provide a variety of inputs, such as lesson plans and training for teachers together with new materials for students) and of mother tongue instruction interventions, as well as from a range of teacher programs, including both remunerative (pay-for-performance of various designs) and non-remunerative (coaching and certain types of training) programs. School feeding delivers gains in both access and learning. New studies also show long-term positive impacts of eliminating school fees for primary school and positive impacts of eliminating fees in secondary school. Education technology interventions have decidedly mixed impacts, as do school grant programs and programs providing individual learning inputs (e.g., uniforms or textbooks).","Evans, David K.

"This essay explores the nuanced impact of generative AI technologies on management and business education, framed through three paradoxes: the Expertise Paradox suggests that AI's adequate performance at lower-level tasks may weaken students' development of higher-level thinking; the Innovation Paradox states that AI's creativity aid could stifle original thinking; and the Equity Paradox highlights AI's potential to provide immense gains to experts but disproportionately harm novices. We take the position that without ""sensible"" AI use guidelines in management education, AI is likely to have a net-negative effect on learning. This stance is based on our trials with ChatGPT on various cognitive tasks organized around the revised Bloom's Taxonomy of learning. We identify areas where AI tools can enhance learning, such as comprehending established subject domains, as well as areas where they exhibit significant limitations, such as logical reasoning and critical thinking. We caution against the potential deskilling in critical thinking due to students' overreliance on AI for basic tasks. To alleviate these challenges, we recommend sensible AI uses by students that support skill development without fostering overreliance. We also suggest how faculty, administrators, and employers may support students in getting the most out of this new tool.","Valcea, Sorin Hamdani, Maria Riaz Wang, Shuai",,"Valcea, S Hamdani, MR Wang, S",915,"[Valcea, Sorin; Wang, Shuai] Cleveland State Univ, Cleveland, OH USA.

"A mental health clinic was developed for toddlers with developmental disabilities and significant behavior problems from families living in poverty. The clinic was a collaborative effort between a community-based Birth-to-Three agency and a university. The purpose of this clinic was threefold: to provide direct mental health services for these young children, to train graduate students to work with this population, and to begin to contribute to the limited research available in this area. This paper describes the clinical intake procedures and outcomes for the 81 children served by the clinic over a 2-year period. Referral concerns included tantrums, aggression, oppositional behaviors, hyperactivity, and self-injury. The children came from a diverse group of families living in poverty; single mothers with less than a high school education headed most of the households. The clinical intake included direct observations of parent-child interactions, child behavior assessments, and parental interviews and self-report measures. For the present sample, 77% of the children met the criteria for a developmental disability and nearly 70% also met the criteria for a psychiatric disorder. The most common diagnosis was oppositional defiant disorder. Discussion regarding the challenges inherent in working with families of toddlers with developmental delays and psychiatric disorders living in low-income circumstances is included.

"This article is located in the wider discourse on the nexus of policy, research and practice of peace education for countering violent extremism (CVE) with a focus on learnings and insights from non-governmental initiatives in Pakistan. It presents an analysis of how the diverse and complex school education system in Pakistan 'does' and/or 'does not' respond to the challenges of an increasing scale and manifestations of violence, conflict and extremism in society. Moving beyond the discussion on the historical emergence, drivers, actors and characteristics of violent extremism in Pakistan, this paper engages with the erstwhile literature on the research-policy-practice nexus to examine nine peace education projects - mostly foreign-funded - in Pakistan. Considering the insights from these nine projects, the paper finds that there are several examples of successful stand-alone peace education for CVE projects but without a link to policy and research. Despite producing good quality CVE and peace education material, and applying these materials successfully in the diverse education setting of the country, many projects lacked sustainability due to over-dependence on foreign funding. Due to comparatively consistent external funding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the organisations there are more successful in their peace education interventions than the ones in Punjab and Sindh.","Ahmed, Zahid Shahab Shahzad, Rizwana",,"Ahmed, ZS Shahzad, R",199,"[Ahmed, Zahid Shahab] Deakin Univ, Alfred Deakin Inst, Burwood, Australia.

"On a global scale, the new coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) brought significant changes in the social, political, economic and educational scenario. Therefore, in the educational field, school units in different countries had to close their doors to ensure social isolation as a measure to curb the spread of the virus. Thus, educational institutions adopted remote classes as a strategy to reduce the impacts caused by the pandemic. Consequently, this change had repercussions on the dynamics of teaching work and on teaching-learning processes and, in this regard, groups of vulnerable students, such as the cases of students with disabilities, were threatened with the guarantee of the right to school education, since these changes accentuated socio-educational inequalities. Given this problematization, this study aims to reflect on the demand for public policies for the provision of special education based on the challenges triggered by the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. For this purpose, we carried out a descriptive documental and bibliographical research based on the confrontation of data on the historical panorama of public educational policies aimed at people with disabilities in Brazil and the regulations for educational provision in the context of the pandemic. It is noted that the demand for the regulation of educational policies that provide the effectiveness of inclusive education, especially in emergency situations such as the Covid-19 pandemic.","Basta, Leandro Santos Sakaue, Suzana Marssaro Souza, Kellcia Rezende",e021001,"Basta, L Sakaue, SMS Souza, KR",,"[Basta, Leandro; Santos Sakaue, Suzana Marssaro; Souza, Kellcia Rezende] Fed Univ Grande Dourados UFGD, Postgrad Program Educ, Dourados, MS, Brazil.

"The diversity of vulnerability conditions, that have prevented children and adolescents from exercising their right to school education, also produces a diversity of cultural references of the public that comes to Basic Education programs for Youth and Adults in developing countries. This diversity often forges appropriation processes of numeracy practices that defy the rationality assumed by hegemonic mathematics and confront us with the insufficiency of not only the syntactic approach, but also the semantic resources in school mathematics teaching. Focusing on events occurring in classrooms of different programs that I have been accompanying in Brazil, I identify and analyze tensions, disputes, and complementarities among the signification efforts being referenced in syntactic, semantic or pragmatic dimensions of language games that constitute the discursive interactions in these contexts. My analysis is based on theoretical tools of language studies that invest in reflections on pragmatics and, as in Wittgenstein's later works, assume that meaning is determined by use, allowing scholars to approach linguistic signification as a social phenomenon and numeracy practices as discursive practices of social subjects in interaction. The findings provide evidence to further discuss the complexity of the classroom, to which the vulnerability of the students' living conditions adds decisive elements, challenges and possibilities.","Ferreira Reis Fonseca, Maria da Conceicao",,"Fonseca, MDFR",395,"[Ferreira Reis Fonseca, Maria da Conceicao] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Educ, 6627 Antonio Carlos Ave, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,,,,,2025-01-19,Youth and Adult Basic Education; Appropriation of School Numeracy Practices; Diversity of forms of life in the classroom; Pragmatics of language; Meaning and signification,10.1007/s11858-019-01110-3,Article,DEC 2019,1863-9704,mcfrfon@gmail.com,406,,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brazil); Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG-Brazil),This research was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brazil) and Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG-Brazil).,LK4AY,,3,ZDM-MATH EDUC,ZDM-Math.

"This paper analyses Botswana's commitment to lifelong learning policy and discusses how it can help the state achieve its vision for sustainable development. First, it argues that while Botswana is renowned for its economic success, it still fails to address positively such traditional challenges as poverty, unemployment and income inequality, which are increasing disproportionately, especially among the youth and non-literate adults. These structural problems can be attributable partly to the low quality of education, which does not enable learners to reduce their risks and vulnerabilities. The paper outlines the concepts of lifelong learning and sustainable development and work from there to analyse the national education policy. It is acknowledged that the state made commendable progress in delivering basic, extension and continuing education since adopting lifelong learning in 1994. However, the delivery failed to use education to transform people's lives. The education itself failed to balance quantity with quality effectively to inculcate a culture of democracy. These issues need to be critically addressed because they invariably hamper Botswana's efforts to deliver quality education and attain its vision for sustainable development. Finally, the paper suggests that the education system should incorporate lifelong learning principles, effectively involve learners in decision making and teach for empowerment.","Maruatona, Tonic",PII 938706134,"Maruatona, T",121,"Univ Botswana, Dept Adult Educ, Gaborone, Botswana.",University of Botswana,,,,,2025-01-19,sustainable development; lifelong learning; adult basic education; out-of-school education; extension education,10.1080/0158037X.2010.544522,Article,,,maruatot@mopipi.ub.bw,138,,,,779UE,EDUCATION,2,STUD CONTIN EDUC,Stud.

"In Western countries, music educators have made efforts to revitalise enthusiasm for music education by integrating more mainstream and culturally-relevant genres into their curriculum. Conversely, current research indicates that popular music pedagogy in mainland China is not encouraged and faces many obstacles, as school music education is used to promote Chinese traditional music and bolster nationalism. This qualitative case study investigates how popular music pedagogy in an international school, based in China, accommodates the diverse cultural backgrounds of its Chinese and non-Chinese students when teaching Western and Chinese popular music. For 6 weeks, I had the privilege of closely observing a music class containing a mixture of 12 Chinese and non-Chinese students at an international secondary school based in Shanghai, China. Findings revealed that students were given autonomy to engage with their preferred music genre during lessons that focused on music performance and composition. Interestingly, Chinese students gravitated towards studying C-pop on their own accord, a domestic and sanitised form of popular music. However, the study of modern popular music genres was not prevalent during the music appraisal lessons. The challenges of integrating Chinese popular music pedagogy in an international classroom setting are also discussed.","Quin, Rhythy",02557614211073809,"Quin, R",502,"[Quin, Rhythy] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,,,,,2025-01-19,c-pop; China; Chinese traditional music; informal learning; music education; popular music,10.1177/02557614211073809,Article,FEB 2022,1744-795X,rhythycaoquin@gmail.com,513,,,,5K5QU,SOCIAL-CHANGE; VALUES,4,INT J MUSIC EDUC,Int.

"This study explored HIV vaccine acceptability and strategies for culturally appropriate dissemination among sexually diverse Aboriginal peoples in Canada, among those at highest HIV risk. We conducted four focus groups (n = 23) with Aboriginal male (1) and female (1) service users, peer educators (1) and service providers (1) in Ontario, Canada. Transcripts were analysed with narrative thematic techniques from grounded theory, using NVivo. Participants' mean age was 37 years; about half (52%) were female, half (48%) Two-spirit or lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB)-identified, 48% had a high-school education or less and 57% were unemployed. Vaccine uptake was motivated by community survival; however, negative HIV vaccine perceptions, historically based mistrust of government and healthcare institutions, perceived conflict between western and traditional medicine, sexual prejudice and AIDS stigma within and outside of Aboriginal communities, and vaccine cost may present formidable obstacles to HIV vaccine acceptability. Culturally appropriate processes of engagement emerged on individual levels (i.e., respect for self-determination, explanations in Native languages, use of modelling and traditional healing concepts) and community levels (i.e., leadership by Aboriginal HIV advocates and political representatives, identification of gatekeepers, and procuring Elders' endorsements). Building on cultural strengths and acknowledging the history and context of mistrust and social exclusion are fundamental to effective HIV vaccine dissemination.","Newman, P. A. Woodford, M. R.

"Different developing economies are encountering various regional challenges associated with income inequality. However, several contributing factors to inequality and access to opportunities, such as a quality education system, have been identified as the key factors. Thus, the study sought to determine the reverse causal nexus between pro-poor policies (government spending on education) and income inequality in Kenya and the spatial linking relationship with the case of Uganda's and Tanzania's economies. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, Johansen cointegration test, and Granger Causality approach were used to model the relationship between pro-poor policies and income inequality using time-series data from 1982 to 2018. The findings indicate positive short- and long-term relationships between government spending on education and income inequality in the three economies. Furthermore, the results show a significant long-term relationship between human capital measures (average years of schooling, secondary school education attainment, and tertiary level education attainment) and income inequality in the three economies. However, the results indicate no reverse causal nexus between the study variables in Kenya and Uganda but unidirectional causal nexus exists in the case of the Tanzanian economy. The study recommends that government stakeholders implement pro-poor policy initiatives that result in the structural change of social infrastructures and enhanced quality of life.","Maket, Isaiah Juma Kano, Izabella Szakalne Vas, Zsofia Boglarka",,"Maket, IJ Kano, IS Vas, ZB",1163,"[Maket, Isaiah Juma; Kano, Izabella Szakalne; Vas, Zsofia Boglarka] Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Szeged, Hungary.",Szeged University,,,,,2025-01-19,government spending on education; Granger causality; income inequality; Kenya,10.1111/rsp3.12540,Article,MAY 2022,,maket.isaiah.juma@o365.u-szeged.hu,1181,,,,U2AD5,COINTEGRATION; EDUCATION; GROWTH,6,REG SCI POLICY PRACT,Reg.

Despite its importance, the integration of CCE in schools is challenging due to the interdisciplinary nature of climate science and the obstacles and demands of everyday school reality.

We focus on Greece, a country that, despite being a hot spot for climate change, shows a low level of CCE integration in schools and awareness for EO-based educational resources. Based on interviews with in-service teachers, our research reveals the following: (a) there is a high interest in how satellites depict environmental phenomena; (b) EO is considered an efficient vehicle for promoting CCE in schools because it illustrates climate change impacts most effectively; (c) local natural disasters, such as intense forest fires and floods, are more familiar to students and, thus, preferable for teaching when compared to global issues, such as the greenhouse effect and sea level rise; and (d) educators are in favor of short, hands-on, EO-based activities (also known as ""activity-shots""), as the most useful material format for integrating climate change topics in their everyday teaching practice.","Asimakopoulou, Panagiota Nastos, Panagiotis Vassilakis, Emmanuel Hatzaki, Maria Antonarakou, Assimina",1587,"Asimakopoulou, P Nastos, P Vassilakis, E Hatzaki, M Antonarakou, A",,"[Asimakopoulou, Panagiota; Nastos, Panagiotis; Vassilakis, Emmanuel; Hatzaki, Maria; Antonarakou, Assimina] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Geol & Geoenvironm, Athens 10679, Greece.",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,,,,,2025-01-19,remote sensing; school education; environmental education; classroom resources; Copernicus; ESA education,10.3390/rs13081587,Article,,2072-4292,passimak@geol.uoa.gr; nastos@geol.uoa.gr; evasilak@geol.uoa.gr; marhat@geol.uoa.gr; aantonar@geol.uoa.gr,,,"project ""PANhellenic infrastructure for Atmospheric Composition and climate change"" - operational program ""Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation"" (NSRF 2014-2020) [MIS 5021516]; European Union (European Regional Development Fund)","The APC was funded by the project ""PANhellenic infrastructure for Atmospheric Composition and climate change"" (MIS 5021516), which is implemented under the action ""Reinforcement of the Research and Innovation Infrastructure"", funded by the operational program ""Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation"" (NSRF 2014-2020) and co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund).",RT8AS,,8,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,English,,72,gold,"Vassilakis, Emmanuel/0000-0002-1175-3628; Nastos, Panagiotis/0000-0001-9336-6586; Asimakopoulou, Panagiota/0000-0001-7157-2688; Hatzaki, Maria/0000-0002-5524-0576; Antonarakou, Assimina/0000-0001-8901-8423","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",APR,17,BASEL,,,J,MDPI,2021,"Hatzaki, Maria/C-4539-2018; Asimakopoulou, Panagiota/LYO-7632-2024; Vassilakis, Emmanuel/B-9083-2009; Nastos, Panagiotis/E-7455-2015","Asimakopoulou, P (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Geol & Geoenvironm, Athens 10679, Greece.",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,REMOTE SENSING,,,6,Earth Observation as a Facilitator of Climate Change Education in Schools: The Teachers' Perspectives,6,27,WOS:000644679200001,13,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),6
"Coming from a disadvantaged background can have negative impact on an individual's educational trajectory. Some people however seem unaffected and cope well with the demands and challenges posed by school education, despite growing up in adverse conditions, a phenomenon termed academic resilience. While it is uncertain which underlying factors make some people more likely to circumvent unfavorable odds than others, both socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive ability have robustly been linked to school performance. The objective of the present work is to investigate if individual cognitive abilities and SES interact in their effect on grades. For this purpose, we analyzed SES, cognitive, and school performance data from 5001 participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Ordinal logistic regression models suggest similar patterns of associations between three SES measures (parental education, income-to-needs ratio, and neighborhood deprivation) and grades at two timepoints, with no evidence for interaction effects between SES and time. Parental education and income-to-needs ratio were associated with grades at both timepoints, irrespective of whether cognitive abilities were modeled or not. Neighborhood deprivation, in contrast, was only a statistically significant predictor of reported grades when cognitive abilities were not factored in. Cognitive abilities interacted with parental education level, meaning that they could be a safeguard against effects of SES on school performance.","Langensee, Lara Rumetshofer, Theodor Martensson, Johan",17,"Langensee, L Rumetshofer, T Mårtensson, J",,"[Langensee, Lara; Rumetshofer, Theodor; Martensson, Johan] Lund Univ, Div Logoped Phoniatr & Audiol, Dept Clin Sci Lund, Scania, Sweden.",Lund University; Scania,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1038/s41539-024-00233-x,Article,,2056-7936,lara.langensee@med.lu.se,,,"Vetenskapsrdet (Swedish Research Council); LMK Foundation [DNR 2017-00896]; Swedish Research Council [U01DA041048, U01DA050989, U01DA051016, U01DA041022, U01DA051018, U01DA051037, U01DA050987, U01DA041174, U01DA041106, U01DA041117, U01DA041028, U01DA041134, U01DA050988, U01DA051039, U01DA041156, U01DA041025, U01DA041120, U01DA051038, U01DA041148, U01DA041093, U01DA041089, U24DA041123, U24DA041147]; National Institutes of Health","This research was funded by the LMK Foundation and the Swedish Research Council (DNR 2017-00896).

"This article details the learning experiences emerging from a research collaboration between a university-based research team and an informal education provider (the STEM Academy). The aim was to enhance the community responsiveness of a series of science clubs for children living in low-income communities in a metropolitan area of Canada. The study examined a new afterschool science club that ran for seven months, serving 20 children aged 8-11. Data sources included focus groups and individual interviews with children attending the club, semi-structured interviews with club staffers and school-based educators associated with the children, and detailed field notes made by a researcher-volunteer after every club session. Data was analyzed using a constant comparative approach which revealed four key lessons that the STEM Academy gained from this experimental club space: (i) Community responsiveness requires power sharing in multiple dimensions; (ii) Enjoying informal science learning can support formal science learning; (iii) The informal club context attends to children's needs and interests beyond science; and (iv) Territorial lines are blurred in community-responsive ventures. The experimental club allowed us to identify and recommend certain approaches for other informal education providers seeking to become more locally relevant (even those operating at multiple sites).","Burke, Lydia E.

"HIV-related stigma negatively affects the lives of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Homeless/unstably housed PLWHA experience myriad challenges and may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of HIV-related stigma. Homeless/unstably housed PLWHA from 3 U.S. cities (N = 637) completed computer-assisted interviews that measured demographics, self-assessed physical and mental health, medical utilization, adherence, HIV disclosure, and risk behaviors. Internal and perceived external HIV stigma were assessed and combined for a total stigma score. Higher levels of stigma were experienced by women, homeless participants, those with a high school education or less, and those more recently diagnosed with HIV. Stigma was strongly associated with poorer self-assessed physical and mental health, and perceived external stigma was associated with recent non-adherence to HIV treatment. Perceived external stigma was associated with decreased HIV disclosure to social network members, and internal stigma was associated with drug use and non-disclosure to sex partners. Interventions are needed to reduce HIV-related stigma and its effects on the health of homeless/unstably housed PLWHA.","Wolitski, Richard J. Pals, Sherri L. Kidder, Daniel P.

"Immigrant children from diverse language backgrounds face not only linguistic challenges when enrolled in mainstream English-medium classrooms, but also difficulties adjusting to an unfamiliar learning community. The culture of primary school classrooms in New Zealand typically reflects conventions across three dimensions: interactional, instructional task performance and cognitive-academic development. All three dimensions are underpinned by the culturally specific discourse conventions involved in language socialisation. New learners may be helped by classmates or their teacher to understand and successfully use these conventions, but left on their own they may sink rather than swim. This is a case study of one Taiwanese 11-year old boy, 'John', who entered a New Zealand primary classroom midway through the school year. John's basic conversational ability was sound, but he did not possess the interactive classroom skills needed to operate in the new culture of learning. Selected from a wider study of the classroom, transcript data from audio-recorded excerpts of John's interactions over several months with his teacher and classmates are interpreted from perspectives derived from sociocultural and language socialisation theories. The article concludes with a brief consideration of the extent to which John constructed, or was constrained from constructing meaningful learning experiences, and suggestions for further research and reflection.","Barnard, Roger",,"Barnard, R",233,"Univ Waikato, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",University of Waikato,,,,,2025-01-19,culture of learning; classroom interaction; language minority students; language-in-education; primary school education; New Zealand,10.1080/09500780802582521,Article,,1747-7581,rbarnard@waikato.ac.nz,248,,,,652SB,EFL; LEVEL,3,LANG EDUC-UK,Lang.

"In the context of our rapidly digitizing society, computational thinking stands out as an essential attribute for cultivating aptitude and expertise. Through the prism of computational thinking, learners are more adeptly positioned to dissect and navigate real-world challenges, poising them effectively to meet the exigencies of future societal landscapes. The paradigm of project-based learning, heralded as a potent educational methodology, significantly amplifies students' prowess in computational thinking. To delineate the nuanced interplay between project-based learning and its augmentation of computational thinking, we engaged in meta-analytical investigations, synthesizing outcomes from 31 distinct external experimental and quasi-experimental studies. Our analytical journey underscored that project-based learning markedly elevates students' competencies across five critical spectra: innovation, collaboration, critical analysis, algorithmic cognition, and problem resolution. Dissecting its impact across the K12 continuum reveals that primary students predominantly hone their collaborative acumen; middle-grade learners witness a pronounced ascent in creativity, critical, and algorithmic faculties, while the apex of high school education primarily sharpens critical analytical prowess. Thus, educators sculpting the contours of project-based learning should be calibrate their strategies, ensuring they resonate with the developmental and age-specific nuances of their audience, to fully unleash its latent potential in nurturing computational thinking.","Zhang, Wuwen Guan, Yurong Hu, Zhihua",,"Zhang, WW Guan, YR Hu, ZH",,"[Zhang, Wuwen] Huanggang Normal Univ, Coll Educ, Huanggang 438000, Peoples R China.

"The article covers the problem of project-based learning (PBL) in present-day foreign language classes. The main aim of this research is to identify how PBL method can be implemented in teaching a foreign language (for example, English as a second language) in a modern comprehensive school and to give recommendations on organizing a foreign language class with the help of PBL. The working hypothesis of the study says that PBL method can be a relevant and effective methodological technique allowing educators to improve the quality of school education and motivating young learners to work hard at L2 classes and study a foreign language better. For the effective analysis and estimation of project-based learning in teaching ESL a two-step experiment was conducted. Overall, the results of the study demonstrated the importance of introduction of project-based learning in foreign language classes as an essential component of the teacher's work in the present-day education. They also proved that project-based learning should be a must in every educator's pedagogical ""piggy-bank"" because PBL is an effective professional instrument which may overcome the latest demands and challenges of the third millennium society.","Guslyakova, Alla Guslyakova, Nina Valeeva, Nailya Veretennikova, Ludmila",e16754,"Guslyakova, A Guslyakova, N Valeeva, N Veretennikova, L",,"[Guslyakova, Alla; Valeeva, Nailya] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, RUDN Univ, Moscow, Russia.

"Background: While research has shown that hospice family caregivers (HFCG) seek additional information related to patient care, pain and symptom management, and self-care, it is unknown how the use of telenovela videos for education in hospice would be received by HFCG. Objective: To explore HFCG perceived benefits and challenges with the use of telenovelas as compared to traditional educational videos during online support group. Methods: A mixed methods study with a concurrent triangulated design that analyzed qualitative interviews and YouTube analytics report to identify how viewers responded (number of views and their feedback) to telenovela videos as compared to traditional educational videos. Results: Among 39 (n = 39) HFCGs, most participants were female (80%) of White/Caucasian race, with more than high school education (85%) and they were adult children of hospice cancer patient (49%). Comparing HFCG that viewed traditional videos with HFCG that viewed telenovela videos, the telenovela video was watched more (12% longer viewing duration) and caregivers reported better content recall with informative benefits, more follow up actions and reflection about their own hospice experience. Conclusion: Caregiver feedback indicated that watching the telenovela was engaging, acceptable and produced more conversations about patient care, than watching a non-telenovela format video. Further research is needed to test telenovela efficacy in enhancing HFCG outcomes.","Cruz-Oliver, Dulce M.

"Educational institutions are crucial environments to promote students' wellbeing. This introduces major challenges into the processes of executing and evaluating programmes such as the ones focused on achieving bullying-free schools. The concept of social wellbeing that is used throughout the present paper is associated to the subjective sense of action in the social construction and understanding of reality. The primary objective was to examine the relationship between Family Support (FS) and Social Wellbeing (SW) of high school education students in the state of Sonora, Mexico, as well as the effect of potential mediation of the School Environment (SE). This research was carried out with a cross-sectional sample of 265 teenagers (average age = 16 years old, SD=1.35), who responded to a self-report scale developed for this research study. The structural model has shown a high predictive power of SE as a mediating variable between FS and SW. Furthermore, both immediate contexts of students, i.e. family and school, were found to be relevant to their emotions and SW, which translates into a lower probability of being a victim of bullying. Therefore, we discuss a concept of SW seen from a perspective related to emotions, where material, economic, and/or monetary factors are not a priority.","Flores-Verduzco, Guadalupe Refugio Fraijo-Sing, Blanca Silvia Tapia-Fonllem, Cesar Octavio",,"Flores-Verduzco, GR Fraijo-Sing, BS Tapia-Fonllem, CO",26,"[Flores-Verduzco, Guadalupe Refugio; Fraijo-Sing, Blanca Silvia; Tapia-Fonllem, Cesar Octavio] Univ Sonora, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.",Universidad de Sonora,,,,,2025-01-19,social wellbeing; school environment; family support; bullying; emotions,,Article,,,guadalupe.flores@unison.mx,40,,,,PR8AY,ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; ENGAGEMENT; VIOLENCE; CLIMATE; HEALTH; NEED,2,INT J EMOT EDUC,Int.

"Japan has recently seen an increase in the number of immigrant children, many of whom face difficulties at school. The country's educational policies have failed to address the needs of these children. As a result, the schools and local municipalities in which these children are educated bear the burden of this problem. This study examines how the social resources and home lives of these immigrant families affect children's schooling and education at high schools. First, the authors describe the problems of the education system in relation to the children of foreign workers and low-wage immigrants in the context of Japan's stringent immigration policy. Then, in a case study, they highlight the ways in which family-related factors, local resources, and an innovative quota system combined with special programs at a local high school affect the schooling and educational success of immigrant students. The results indicated that most foreign children newly arrived in Japan due to the transnational movement of their parents had limited family resources and limited Japanese language skills and that external networks helped such children continue on to high school. The paper concludes by suggesting that integrated measures, including institutional admission arrangements and social supports, are needed to provide immigrant children of low socioeconomic status with adequate educational opportunities.","Kobayashi, Hiromi Tsuboya, Mioko",,"Kobayashi, H Tsuboya, M",369,"[Kobayashi, Hiromi] Bunkyo Gakuin Univ, Dept Human Studies, 1196 Kamekubo, Fujimino, Saitama 3568533, Japan.

"Research studies of post-school education and training conducted in Australia and internationally have revealed a mosaic of students' education and employment experiences, with a multiplicity of nonlinear pathways. These tend to be more fragmentary for disadvantaged students, especially those of low socio-economic background, rural students, and mature aged students seeking a 'second chance' education. Challenges faced by students in their transitions to higher education are made more complex because of the intersection of vertical stratification created by institutional and sectoral status hierarchies and segmentation, especially relating to 'academic' and 'vocational' education and training, and the horizontal stratification of regional, rural and remote locations in which students live. If we are to achieve the equity goals set by the Bradley Review (Bradley et al., Review of Australian Higher Education Final Report, 2008) we need to acknowledge and work with the complex realities of disadvantaged students' situations, starting at the school level. Interrelated factors at the individual, community and institutional level which continue to inhibit student take-up of higher education places are discussed in the context of discursive constructions of 'disadvantage' and 'choice' in late modernity. Research highlights the need to facilitate students' post-school transitions by developing student resilience, institutional responsiveness and policy reflexivity through transformative education.","Abbott-Chapman, Joan",,"Abbott-Chapman, J",57,"[Abbott-Chapman, Joan] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Res Inst, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research,,,,,2025-01-19,Post-school transitions; Higher education; Access; Equity; Widening participation; Discursive practices,10.1007/s13384-010-0001-9,Article,,2210-5328,J.AbbottChapman@utas.edu.au,71,,,,782PR,VOCATIONAL-EDUCATION; YOUNG-PEOPLE; PARTICIPATION; UNIVERSITY; PERSPECTIVES; DISCOURSE; DIVERSITY,1,AUST EDUC RES,Aust.

"Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced drastic changes in all layers of life. Social distancing and lockdown drove the educational system to uncharted territories at an accelerated pace, leaving educators little time to adjust. Objectives: To describe changes in teaching during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We described the steps implemented at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine during the initial 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic to preserve teaching and the academic ecosystem. Results: Several established methodologies, such as the flipped classroom and active learning, demonstrated effectiveness. In addition, we used creative methods to teach clinical medicine during the ban on bedside teaching and modified community engagement activities to meet COVID-19 induced community needs. Conclusions: The challenges and the lessons learned from teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to adjust our teaching methods and curriculum using multiple online teaching methods and promoting self-learning. It also provided invaluable insights on our pedagogy and the teaching of medicine in the future with emphasis on students and faculty being part of the changes and adjustments in curriculum and teaching methods. However, personal interactions are essential to medical school education, as are laboratories, group simulations, and bedside teaching.","Flugelman, Moshe Y.

"BackgroundColombia has seen an increase in heroin use, leading to higher HIV rates and challenges in accessing treatment for people who use opioids (PWUO). With widespread mobile phone ownership, technology-based interventions show promise in Colombia. This study aims to understand technology use patterns among PWUO in Colombia, aiding the development of targeted mHealth interventions for better treatment outcomes.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among adults with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) from harm reduction centers, inpatient detoxification units, and methadone maintenance treatment programs in three Colombian cities with high OUD prevalence. The survey covered sociodemographic characteristics, OUD treatment receipt, technology ownership and use patterns, and preferences for technology-based interventions.ResultsAmong 247 participants, the majority were men, single, with a mean age of 29.9 years, and mainly had high school education. Smartphone ownership was reported by 43.6%, with preferences for social networking apps, internet browsers, and text messaging. Bivariate analysis showed associations between technology ownership and factors such as age, education, sex, and household stability.ConclusionThese findings provide insights into the technology use patterns and preferences among PWUO in Colombia, highlighting implications for designing and implementing effective technology-based interventions to enhance OUD treatment outcomes.","Borda, Juan P.

"The article contains a comparative analysis of climate change education in geography education in Czechia and Poland. The topic of climate and its changes is one of the most current challenges for school education at the beginning of the 21st century. The aim of the research was to establish the similarities and differences in the content of teaching climate change in the core curricula and selected textbooks for teaching geography in both countries. Using the method of text analysis, the study covered the core curricula of geography and 22 geography textbooks for primary and secondary school students, including 11 Czech and 11 Polish. The quantitative analysis of the content (the term ""climate "" and its derivatives, and ""climate change "") and the qualitative analysis of the content of curriculum documents and school textbooks led to the basic conclusion that Czech and Polish students using textbooks for learning geography have the opportunity to learn content on: 1/ factors influencing climate change, 2/ causes of climate change, 3/ global warming, 4/ deforestation, 5/ desertification, 6/ melting of glaciers, 7/ consequences of climate change, and 8/ methods of counteracting climate change. By implementing the assumptions of the geography core curricula relating to climate change education and using textbooks during geography lessons, teachers can influence the pro-ecological attitudes of school children.","Baarova, Barbara Hibszer, Adam",,"Baarova, B Hibszer, A",35,"[Baarova, Barbara] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Human Geog & Reg Dev, Chittussiho 10 Str, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic.

"Advances in visualisation techniques provide new ways for us to explore how we introduce complex topics like remote sensing to non-specialist audiences. Taking inspiration from the popularity of augmented reality (AR) apps, a free, mobile digital AR app titled SatelliteSkill5, has been developed for both Androids and iPhones in Unity AR. SatelliteSkill5 helps users conceptualise remote sensing (RS) theory and technology by showcasing the potential of datasets such as multispectral images, SAR backscatter, drone orthophotography, and bathymetric LIDAR for tackling real-world challenges, with examples tackling many of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the focus. Leveraging tried and tested pedagogic practices such as active learning, game-based learning, and targeting cross-curricular topics, SatelliteSkill5 introduces users to many of the fundamental geospatial data themes identified by the UN as essential for meeting the SDGs, imparting users with a familiarity of concepts such as land cover, elevation, land parcels, bathymetry, and soil. The SatelliteSkill5 app was piloted in 12 Irish schools during 2021 and 2022 and with 861 students ranging from 12 to 18 years old. This research shows that both students and teachers value learning in an easy-to-use AR environment and that SDGs help users to better understand complex remote sensing theory.","McNerney, Eimear Faull, Jonathan Brown, Sasha McNerney, Lorraine Foley, Ronan Lonergan, James Rickard, Angela Kucuk, Zerrin Doganca Behan, Avril Essel, Bernard Mensah, Isaac Obour Campo, Yeray Castillo Cullen, Helen Ffrench, Jack Abernethy, Rachel Cleary, Patricia Byrne, Aengus Cahalane, Conor",5480,"McNerney, E Faull, J Brown, S McNerney, L Foley, R Lonergan, J Rickard, A Kucuk, ZD Behan, A Essel, B Mensah, IO Campo, YC Cullen, H Ffrench, J Abernethy, R Cleary, P Byrne, A Cahalane, C",,"[McNerney, Eimear; Behan, Avril] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Surveying & Construct Innovat, Dublin D01 K822, Ireland.

"Objective: To evaluate the relationship between amount of time taken to sign one's name and health literacy. Methods: A prospective, one time assessment was conducted on a convenience sample of 98 patients recruited in an inner-city outpatient internal medicine clinic. The amount of time required to sign (i.e. initiation to completion of writing) was measured by stopwatch. Health literacy was measured with the REALM. Results: The sample averaged 54.1 (SD 16.2) years of age. Twenty-seven percent had less than high school education and 33% had a terminal general equivalency diploma or high school degree. The time required to sign ranged from 0.91 to 21.3 s. Sixty-two percent of the sample had health literacy challenges. Signature time was longest for those with inadequate health literacy (mean 10.0 s), compared with marginal (7.3 s) and adequate (4.7 s, p <= 0.001). Signature time remained significant in a logistic regression model after controlling for education and age (AOR = 0.785, CI = 0.661-0.932). Conclusion: Individuals with signatures completed in six seconds or less were highly likely to display adequate health literacy. Practice implications: Signature time may offer a practical and quick approach to health literacy screening in the health care setting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"Background: Rapid diagnostics tests for malaria (RDT) have become established as a practical solution to the challenges of parasitological confirmation of malaria before treatment in the public sector. However, little is known of their impact in private health sector facilities, such as pharmacies and drug shops. This study aimed to assess the incidence of malaria among unwell patients seeking anti-malarial treatment in two community pharmacies in Nigeria and measure the impact RDTs have on anti-malarial sales. Methods: This was a comparison study of two pharmacies located in the suburbs of Gwagwalada, in the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria, between May and July 2012. In the intervention arm, patients seeking to purchase anti-malarials had an RDT performed before treatment while the control pharmacy continued normal routine practice. Results: A total of 1,226 participants were enrolled into the study. The incidence of malaria in the intervention arm (n = 619) was 13.6% and adolescent participants had a statistically significant higher incidence (26.0%) compared to adults (11.9%) (P = 0.001). A history of fever in the last 48 hours was associated with a statistically significant higher incidence of malaria (28.3%) (P < 0.001). Having a RDT test reduced the chance of purchasing an anti-malarial by 42% (95% CI: 38%-46%) compared to not having a test. 51.6% (276) of the study participants with a RDT negative result still purchased anti-malarials, especially if anti-malarials had been recommended by a health professional (58.9%) compared to self-referral (44.2%) (P = 0.001). Patients with RDT negative results were also more likely to purchase an anti-malarial if there was a reported malaria positive laboratory test prior to presentation (66.2%; P = 0.007), a history of fever in the last 48 hours (60.5%; P = 0.027), and primary school education or less (69.4%; P = 0.009). After adjusting for age group and gender differences, having at least a secondary school education reduced the chance of buying an anti-malarial (OR 0.504 (95% CI: 0.256-0.993)) compared to having primary education or lower. Conclusion: The study highlights the enormous potential for improving appropriate prescription of anti-malarials in pharmacies and preventing unnecessary use of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT).","Ikwuobe, John O.

"BACKGROUNDPatients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) generally have poor knowledge, attitude, and practice of their disease, while the data from China are lacking.AIMTo address this knowledge disparity among Chinese patients with IBD.METHODSThis web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted on a cohort of IBD patients who visited the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between December 2022 and February 2023. Their socio-demographic information and the knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were collected and estimated using a self-designed questionnaire. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the pairwise correlations among knowledge, attitude, and practice scores. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was further performed to determine the independent factors associated with their knowledge, attitude, and practice scores.RESULTSA total of 353 patients (224 males) with IBD completed the questionnaires. The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were 10.05 +/- 3.46 (possible range: 0-14), 41.58 +/- 5.23 (possible range: 0-56), 44.20 +/- 7.39 (possible range: 0-56), respectively, indicating good knowledge, positive attitude, and proactive practice toward IBD. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the knowledge score had significant positive correlations with the attitude score (r = 0.371, P < 0.001) and practice score (r = 0.100, P < 0.001). The attitude score had a significant positive correlation with the practice score (r = 0.452, P < 0.001). Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that aged 30-40 years [odds ratio (OR) = 4.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-15.82, P = 0.043], middle school education (OR = 3.98, 95%CI: 1.29-12.33, P = 0.017), high school/technical secondary school education (OR = 14.06, 95%CI: 3.92-50.38, P < 0.001), and junior college/bachelor's degree and above education (OR = 15.20, 95%CI: 4.15-55.650, P < 0.001) were independently associated with good knowledge. The higher knowledge score was independently associated with a positive attitude (OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.11-1.36, P < 0.001). The higher attitude score was independently associated with proactive practice (OR = 1.20, 95%CI: 1.11-1.30, P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONChinese patients with IBD might have good knowledge, a positive attitude, and proactive practice toward their disease.

"This paper is one of three sequential papers interrogating equity in partnerships (or partnering relationships [PRs]) in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. In this piece, we prioritize abundance framing and dignity-conferring work when engaging in partnerships with and for communities who have been historically marginalized. We propose a framework of seven drivers that define the directions and/or success of PRs: (1) mission, vision, or values; (2) goals or outcomes; (3) practices or processes; (4) power, privilege, or oppression; (5) communities and geography; (6) time and urgency; and (7) partners. This framework can be used to examine PRs at any phase of their existence to ensure equity-centered and dignity-conferring processes and outcomes. We discuss case studies that are common or specific challenges or frustrations that occur in nonequity-centered PRs. We frame these as six vexations: (1) sustainable PRs; (2) dignity-conferring PRs; (3) repetitive PRs; (4) political PRs; (5) ""mission trip"" PRs; (6) and deceptive PRs. We address these by using a data feminist lens (a perspective inspired by the book Data Feminism that centers on justice in defining and presenting outcomes), and future dreamings (a perspective that centers on potential ahead) to define our suggestions for designing intentional endings of partnerships.","Santos, Stephany Scipio, Deana",,"Santos, S Scipio, D",1214,"[Santos, Stephany] Univ Connecticut, Dept Biomed Engn, Storrs, CT USA.

"Bioengineering represents an interdisciplinary field with the potential to engage young learners in science inquiry and engineering design in the context of real-world challenges. Although children encounter bioengineered products and solutions in their everyday lives, they are not introduced to bioengineering until much later in school, after stereotype threats about STEM engagement have crystallized. The purpose of this paper is to present an experimental tangible tool called CRISPEE and evidence from an intervention with young children who explored CRISPEE in the context of an informal bioengineering curriculum. In this design study, 25 children aged 4-7 years engaged in a 9-h workshop designed to introduce them to foundational bioengineering concepts of gene editing, engineering design, and bioethics. Children's attitudes and content knowledge about life science, engineering, and bioengineering were assessed pre- and post-interventions. Mixed quantitative and qualitative results show that most children entered the intervention with pre-existing ideas about genes and attitudes about engineering and science. Post intervention, children demonstrated increased positive STEM attitudes and content knowledge, especially in the area of science inquiry, and also demonstrated an emerging curiosity about the purpose and effectiveness of bioengineering work, including bioethics. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","Strawhacker, Amanda Verish, Clarissa Shaer, Orit Bers, Marina",,"Strawhacker, A Verish, C Shaer, O Bers, M",319,"[Strawhacker, Amanda; Bers, Marina] Tufts Univ, Dept Child Study & Human Dev, 105 Coll Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA.

"This study aims to understand how students manage higher technical education and contribute to research on institutional culture, STEM education, and students' educational strategies by identifying patterns of how students navigate within one university's engineering education. To achieve this, we define and use the concept of technical science capital and habitus reconstruction. We collected data through a survey sent to engineering students who have followed an engineering program's intended linear progression and those who have taken a 'detour' within the same cohort at one specific Swedish university. The survey had a high number of qualitative questions, including free text answers that captured students' narratives. The results indicate that having a large amount of technical science capital alone is not enough for students to be successful in their studies. The university culture has its own structure, which can be intolerant. Within this culture, specific social skills and experiences are desirable, which provides students from a particular background with a greater opportunity for success. Despite possessing high technical science capital, students from other social groups or cultures face challenges. We discuss various measures that could make higher technical education more engaging. This study is limited to one Swedish university, and future studies could include a broader sample that represents several universities.","Engstrom, Susanne Blom, Johanna",,"Engström, S Blom, J",1419,"[Engstrom, Susanne; Blom, Johanna] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Ind Engn & Management, Dept Learning Engn Sci, ITM, Brinellvagen 68, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",Royal Institute of Technology,,,,,2025-01-19,Technical science capital; Habitus reconstructions; Engineering education; Equality issues in education,10.1007/s10798-023-09870-6,Article,DEC 2023,1573-1804,sengstro@kth.se,1439,,Royal Institute of Technology,No Statement Available,YP4R8,WOMEN; IDENTITY; FUTURE; MATHEMATICS; POLICY,4,INT J TECHNOL DES ED,Int.

"High Leverage Practices (HLPs), as a core set of teaching practices, represent important instructional priorities and provide instructional guidance for students' engagement in practice-based instruction. The goals of this research were to 1) understand how an epistemic community (the people designing and leading courses and programs) viewed the HLP creation process, 2) understand the processes through which the epistemic community actually engaged in the refinement of the HLPS, and 3) identify and present the HLPs created. Data collected across the 2019-2020 academic year included interviews with seven instructors and seven students and four observations of the integration team meetings. First, thematic analysis revealed that the epistemic community members considered the process of creating and refining HLPs central to improving the quality of their instruction. Second, the processes through which the community engaged in HLP refinement included connecting experience and feedback with educational research, identifying the purpose of instructional strategies, sharing practices for instruction, and creating a model for course expansion. Third, the HLPs produced included: 1) eliciting students' initial ideas, 2) informing approaches to problems, and 3) developing informed solutions to address community environmental challenges. This work informs in the literature, especially in applied STEM education, about HLP creation in the context of an epistemic community.","Park, Byung-Yeol Campbell-Montalvo, Rebecca Campbell, Todd Cooke, Hannah Arnold, Chester Volin, John C.

"The recent emphasis in higher education on both student engagement and online learning encouraged the authors to develop an active e-learning environment for an introductory geohazards course, which enrolls 70+ undergraduate students per semester. Instructors focused on replicating the achievements and addressing the challenges within an already established face-to-face student-centered class (Brudzinski and Sikorski 2010; Sit 2013). Through the use of a learning management system (LMS) and other available technologies, a wide range of course components were developed including online homework assignments with automatic grading and tailored feedback, video tutorials of software programs like Google Earth and Microsoft Excel, and more realistic scientific investigations using authentic and freely available data downloaded from the internet. The different course components designed to engage students and improve overall student learning and development were evaluated using student surveys and instructor reflection. Each component can be used independently and intertwined into a face-to-face course. Results suggest that significant opportunities are available in an online environment including the potential for improved student performance and new datasets for educational research. Specifically, results from pre and post-semester Geoscience Concept Inventory (GCI) testing in an active e-learning course show enhanced student learning gains compared to face-to-face lecture-based and student-centered courses.","Sit, Stefany M.

"Recently, community-derived core concepts for neuroscience higher education were developed and published. These core concepts can serve as a valuable resource to ensure that a neuroscience-based educational program is not only concept-focused but also addresses the call for reform of higher education, as noted in the vision and change report. The number of undergraduate neuroscience programs is expanding throughout the nation, but unfortunately, the existing blueprints to design and launch such programs do not incorporate these core concepts. Furthermore, unpacking these core concepts in a resource-limited setting is logistically challenging. We reflected on the coverage of these core concepts within our existing neuroscience minor at a medium-sized, primarily residential, high undergraduate, public 4-year institution. In addition to assessing the number of community-derived core concepts addressed in our courses, our reflection discusses strategies for addressing challenges associated with (1) a departmental home for the program, (2) a meaningful student experience with limited resources, and (3) growing and developing the program into a minor, or from a minor into a major. These strategies may provide a roadmap for other institutions to launch or grow their own neuroscience program.","Stocker, Adam M.

"Top-down decision-making process has revealed several challenges in educational reforms in North-West part of Pakistan. Political bosses and bureaucrats have often placed an authoritarian decision-making process where school reforms are implemented without much consultation with school teachers' unions. Given the continued need of school teachers' unions being one of the main stakeholders, it is necessary to examine the perspectives and experiences of the leadership of school teachers' unions' who work hard to make niche on the basis of social justice approach in the top bottom decision making process and to identify ways to implement democratic decision making process. The purpose of the current exploratory qualitative study was to investigate school teachers' unions' leadership experiences in the top bottom decision making process, and their overall perspectives on the school-based reforms. This paper explores the perspectives and experiences of five most influential school teachers' unions' leaders regarding the nature of the decision-making process. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews and was analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that leaders faced several challenges in making their voices count in the current decision-making mechanism. Findings revealed the top-bottom decision-making mechanism is based on vested interests, disregarding the ground realities. School teachers' unions challenge the top bottom approach and support initiatives for evidence-based knowledge, arranging conferences and debates, using print and electronic media to convey their views. They are also use strikes and demonstrations as their last option. The study implies that there is a need for a democratic decision-making mechanism where the input from the school teachers' unions is given due consideration in school based reforms.","Rehman, Ahsan Ur Ahmad, Syed Munir Khan, Muhammad Ilyas",102437,"Rehman, AU Ahmad, SM Khan, MI",,"[Rehman, Ahsan Ur] Sarhad Univ Sci & Informat Technol Peshawar, Dept Educ, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

"Context-based STEM learning has been proven to be useful as interdisciplinary storylines to regulate the flow and sequencing of lessons to obtain expected outcomes. This case study pilot project aims to contextualise scientific learning to local culture. Student groups sampled from two schools in distinct social backgrounds, reflected varied Indian population. Pre-service middle school science and social studies teachers conducted eight lessons as an interdisciplinary storyline with a few natural and social science concepts utilising an artefact representing the cultural history of India for seventh-graders. Data were collected through manually recording of students' responses and products made during class activities; researchers' observations and pre-service teachers' feedback about finding solutions to the difficulties faced. In order to address three research questions about socio-cultural context in science-curriculum design, student adoption of 3D learning, and overcoming teachers' challenges, a thematic analysis of data through the lens of five science practices and one crosscutting concept was performed. This study supported context-based STEM learning for the twenty-first century and strengthened cultural anchoring from an early stage implying the need for teacher professional development, curricular reform, and school infrastructure improvements to support policy implementation. Such researches may be extended to varied sociocultural contexts and discipline combinations to offer broader perspectives.","Sardana, Sushma Muddgal, Alka",,"Sardana, S Muddgal, A",1378,"[Sardana, Sushma; Muddgal, Alka] Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Amity Inst Educ, Noida, India.

"The scale and importance of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action challenges us to ask fundamental questions about widespread transformation of college biology instruction. I propose that we have clarified the ""vision"" but lack research-based models and evidence needed to guide the ""change."" To support this claim, I focus on several key topics, including evidence about effective use of active-teaching pedagogy by typical faculty and whether certain programs improve students' understanding of the Vision and Change core concepts. Program evaluation is especially problematic. While current education research and theory should inform evaluation, several prominent biology faculty-development programs continue to rely on self-reporting by faculty and students. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty-development overviews can guide program design. Such studies highlight viewing faculty members as collaborators, embedding rewards faculty value, and characteristics of effective faculty-development learning communities. A recent National Research Council report on discipline-based STEM education research emphasizes the need for long-term faculty development and deep conceptual change in teaching and learning as the basis for genuine transformation of college instruction. Despite the progress evident in Vision and Change, forward momentum will likely be limited, because we lack evidence-based, reliable models for actually realizing the desired ""change.""","D'Avanzo, Charlene",,"D'Avanzo, C",373,"Hampshire Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1187/cbe.13-01-0010,Article,,,cdavanzo@hampshire.edu,382,,"NSF Division of Undergraduate Education awards [0840911, 0920186, 0127388]; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Undergraduate Education [0920186] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [0127388] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [0840911] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This project was supported by NSF Division of Undergraduate Education awards 0840911, 0920186, and 0127388.

"In the Republic of Ireland, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs recommends implementing play-based learning in early education curricula. This research study set out to explore the following research question: What are pre-school teachers' beliefs, understandings and uses of play-based approaches to develop language and literacy skills in their classrooms? For this study, the term pre-school refers to the age category of children from 2 years and 8 months to 5 years of age. This age cohort is the age of eligibility for the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme in Ireland which provides financial support for 2 years of early childhood care and education for children aged 2.5 to 5 years of age. This study aimed to explore the tools pre-school teachers used to implement play-based approaches in their classrooms; the challenges and facilitators they perceived when implementing play-based approaches, and to understand how play-based approaches were implemented specifically for language and literacy development. The study design was qualitative and nine semi-structured interviews were completed with pre-school teachers. Results from the thematic analysis highlighted the three themes: (1) Learning Through Play, (2) What Influences Play and (3) Making Sense of Play Through Reflective Practice. These three themes consist of several sub-themes which are evident throughout each theme. The results of this study showed that pre-school teachers have a positive view towards play-based approaches for children's language and literacy development. However, they were unsure about implementing play-based approaches with other curriculum models. Challenges such as settings' philosophies and parents' expectations emerged as key elements of pre-school teachers' experiences of using play-based approaches.","Roche, Aoife Carroll, Clare O'Malley, Mary-Pat",,"Roche, A Carroll, C O'Malley, MP",278,"[Roche, Aoife] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Coll Med Nursing & Hlth Sci, Galway, Ireland.

"Background: Patients diagnosed with COPD residing in rural areas report a lower quality of life. Telehealth addresses geographic barriers by offering routine, technology-based visits, and remote patient monitoring.Objective: The study objective was to explore adoption perceptions of a tele-COPD program among community members in rural Western North Carolina (WNC) counties.Methods: A convenience sample of 17 community members were recruited to participate in one of five 45-min focus groups. Before the focus group, all participants completed a brief demographic survey. Focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, imported into MAXQDA v10, and analyzed thematically using established qualitative coding procedures. SPSS v22 was used to calculate descriptive statistics. Results: Participants were primarily Non-Hispanic White (100%), male (59%), insured (100%), and had at least a high school education (80%). Only 25% of participants had any prior knowledge of telehealth programs. The majority (94%) of participants expressed interest in receiving a tele-COPD program due to convenience factors. Yet, most participants expressed a lack of interest and comfort in using Internet-capable devices (e.g., mobile devices, tablets, computers). Participants noted that to be successful, telehealth visits must be described and shown to them by their own provider or other trusted individual(s), such as a pharmacist. Privacy and cost were also expressed as telehealth concerns.Conclusion: Interest in a tele-COPD program was high among community residents in rural WNC. However, to increase patient willingness to adopt a tele-COPD program, patients' providers must overcome challenges, such as patients' awareness and knowledge of telehealth, privacy and cost concerns, and access to and comfort with using new technologies. Pharmacists may mitigate these challenges by increasing patients' trust and comfort with telehealth programs.","Alexander, Dayna S. Kiser, Stephanie North, Steve Roberts, Courtney A.

"A distance education Diploma and Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Science programs are faced with low enrollment and graduation rate as well as high attrition of students. The aforementioned challenges are attributed to students' satisfaction and continuance intention. However, students' satisfaction and continuance intention toward distance education programs are as a result of certain antecedents. This modeled the determinants of satisfaction and program continuance intention by the distance education students on the math and science programs. Based on this, a quantitative approach based on a census survey was adopted and data collected from 113 students through a questionnaire and analyzed using a structural equation modeling approach based on partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results of the study showed that two key antecedents: student-instructor interaction, and study center physical facilities determine program satisfaction of mathematics and science distance students. However, administrative support of the program determined instructional modules; facilitation quality was predicted by both instructional modules and laboratory facilities. Finally, students program continuance intention was predicted by satisfaction of the program. Based on the findings, recommendations were made for policy and practice toward improving students' satisfaction and promote positive intention in pursuant of mathematics and science education program by distance mode.","Bervell, Brandford Nyagorme, Paul Armah, Justice K.

"UNESCO's Sustainable Development Goal 4 and new curricula around the world call for a better quality of education. Among the main challenges of improving quality is increasing the integration between disciplines and improving the preparation of students for the personal and work requirements of a smarter and rapidly changing society. For that purpose, we need to design new and effective didactic strategies. However, current classrooms are isolated. They practically never connect. This hinders the exchange of ideas. It inhibits imitation and recombination, the basic blocks of cultural evolution and innovation. In this paper, we analyze four online interclass tournaments that we have implemented in the last decade. This long-term view is crucial for estimating the sustainability of new teaching strategies. These tournaments are very uncommon lessons, where entire elementary or middle school classes interconnect synchronously and play an educational game. This increased interconnectedness is only possible thanks to digital communication technology. We found that these interclass tournaments are feasible to implement in schools; that they are a promising mechanism for teaching with an increased integration of disciplines; and that they facilitate imitation, recombination, and innovation of teaching strategies. Thus, interclass tournaments could be a feasible strategy to help innovate and improve the quality of education.","Araya, Roberto",8047,"Araya, R",,"[Araya, Roberto] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago 8320000, Chile.",Universidad de Chile,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; educational technology; sustainable development goals; online inter-class tournaments,10.3390/su15108047,Article,,2071-1050,roberto.araya.schulz@gmail.com,,,ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003],"This work was supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), with grant ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003.",H6DQ5,,10,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,English,,81,gold,"Araya, Roberto/0000-0003-2598-8994","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",MAY 15,25,BASEL,,,J,MDPI,2023,"Araya, Roberto/GOH-1299-2022","Araya, R (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago 8320000, Chile.",Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,SUSTAINABILITY,,,1,"Connecting Classrooms with Online Interclass Tournaments: A Strategy to Imitate, Recombine and Innovate Teaching Practices",2,7,WOS:000996851100001,15,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),1
"Socioscientific issues (SSI) are often used to facilitate students' engagement in multiple scientific practices such as decision-making and argumentation, both of which are goals of STEM literacy, science literacy, and integrated STEM education. Literature often emphasizes scientific argumentation over socioscientific argumentation, which involves considering social factors in addition to scientific frameworks. Analyzing students' socioscientific arguments may reveal how students construct such arguments and evaluate pedagogical tools supporting these skills. In this study, we examined students' socioscientific arguments regarding three SSI on pre- and post-assessments in the context of a course emphasizing SSI-based structured decision-making. We employed critical integrative argumentation (CIA) as a theoretical and analytical framework, which integrates arguments and counterarguments with stronger arguments characterized by identifying and refuting counterarguments. We hypothesized that engaging in structured decision-making, in which students integrate multidisciplinary perspectives and consider tradeoffs of various solutions based upon valued criteria, may facilitate students' development of integrated socioscientific arguments. Findings suggest that students' arguments vary among SSI contexts and may relate to students' identities and perspectives regarding the SSI. We conclude that engaging in structured decision-making regarding personally relevant SSI may foster more integrated argumentation skills, which are critical to engaging in information-laden democratic societies.","Sparks, Rachel A.

"Parents boost STEM skills by scaffolding children's attention and discovery during play, but many need support doing so. Using human-centered design (HCD) methods, we created activity kits fostering parents' (a) involvement in and (b) valuing of parent-child play to promote preschoolers' STEM skills. Study 1 documents how HCD methods informed the design of guided activity kits. In initial home visits, we videorecorded six parent-child dyads playing with basic building materials. Play revealed minimal parental STEM scaffolding and talk. Collaborating with 18 families and drawing on prior research, parent interviews, videotaped play sessions, and advisory-board members' expertise, the interdisciplinary research team designed and refined activity kit prototypes. Study 2 was a randomized field test comparing use and evaluation of final guided kits (n = 50) versus basic kits (n = 25) that contained identical building materials and challenges but omitted scaffolding guides. Both groups received kits by mail every other week for 10 weeks. Relative to parents given basic kits, parents given guided kits (a) reported significantly more sustained use of the kits across the 10 weeks, (b) felt more self-efficacy in fostering their child's STEM learning, and (c) judged that their child had achieved greater STEM-skill learning from program use.","Bierman, Karen L.

"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic initiated major disruptions to higher education systems. Physical spaces that previously supported interpersonal interaction and community were abruptly inactivated, and faculty largely took on the responsibility of accommodating classroom structures in rapidly changing situations. This study employed interviews to examine how undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) instructors adapted instruction to accommodate the mandated transition to virtual learning and how these accommodations supported or hindered community and belonging during the onset of the pandemic. Interviews with 25 STEM faculty at an undergraduate Hispanic Serving Institution revealed a wide range of accommodations they made to their courses and how they managed communication with students. Faculty strived to support student belonging with responses ranging from caring to crisis management, though some faculty expressed feelings of powerlessness when unable to accommodate certain challenges. The case of a responsive and flexible instructor is presented to highlight a productive response to a crisis. These retrospective findings point to strategies to support faculty teaching in virtual learning environments in the future; increasing opportunities for student-student and student-faculty interaction, supporting faculty in learning technologies that support these interactions and addressing faculty's feelings of powerlessness.","Thacker, Ian Seyranian, Viviane Madva, Alex Beardsley, Paul",632,"Thacker, I Seyranian, V Madva, A Beardsley, P",,"[Thacker, Ian] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Educ Psychol, San Antonio, TX 78207 USA.

"We discuss transforming STEM education using three aspects: learning progressions (LPs), constructed response performance assessments, and artificial intelligence (AI). Using LPs to inform instruction, curriculum, and assessment design helps foster students' ability to apply content and practices to explain phenomena, which reflects deeper science understanding. To measure the progress along these LPs, performance assessments combining elements of disciplinary ideas, crosscutting concepts and practices are needed. However, these tasks are time-consuming and expensive to score and provide feedback for. Artificial intelligence (AI) allows to validate the LPs and evaluate performance assessments for many students quickly and efficiently. The evaluation provides a report describing student progress along LP and the supports needed to attain a higher LP level. We suggest using unsupervised, semi-supervised ML and generative AI (GAI) at early LP validation stages to identify relevant proficiency patterns and start building an LP. We further suggest employing supervised ML and GAI for developing targeted LP-aligned performance assessment for more accurate performance diagnosis at advanced LP validation stages. Finally, we discuss employing AI for designing automatic feedback systems for providing personalized feedback to students and helping teachers implement LP-based learning. We discuss the challenges of realizing these tasks and propose future research avenues.","Kaldaras, Leonora Haudek, Kevin Krajcik, Joseph",57,"Kaldaras, L Haudek, K Krajcik, J",,"[Kaldaras, Leonora] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.

"Echoing the increasing emphasis on STEM literacy, computational thinking has become a national priority in K-12 schools. Scholars have acknowledged abstraction as the keystone of computational thinking. To foster K-12 students' computational thinking and STEM literacy, students' ability to think abstractly should be enhanced. However, the existing curriculum in K-12 education may not adequately equip learners with the proper abstraction needed for the STEM workforce. Given the absence of a synthesized understanding of abstraction, effective instructional guidance for fostering student abstraction is also elusive. To overcome the gap in understanding abstraction, we attempted to conceptualize a synthesized framework of abstraction in computational thinking and proposed a set of design guidelines that may enhance students' uptake of abstraction. In this paper, we describe the importance of abstraction in computational thinking and existing challenges in developing students' ability to perform abstraction. Then, by reviewing the cognitive dimensions of abstraction and the role of abstraction in computing education, we identify three cognitive processes underlying abstraction in computational thinking (e.g., filtering information, locating similarities, and mapping problem structures). We thereby propose a conceptual framework of abstraction in computational thinking. Finally, design guidelines for fostering abstraction in computational thinking are provided with illustrated examples of a tailored STEM-integrative learning environment.","Qian, Yingxiao Choi, Ikseon",,"Qian, YX Choi, I",1055,"[Qian, Yingxiao] Univ South Carolina, Coll Educ, Dept Educ Studies, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.

"Educational robotics activities have proven instrumental in creating a dynamic learning environment that provides students with hands-on experiences, aligning with the interdisciplinary principles advocated by STEM education. The integration of educational robotics into the educational process significantly impacts students of various age groups, fostering the acquisition and enhancement of diverse skills. However, the effective implementation of robotics hinges on teachers. This research aims to design a valid instrument (AKAER) to quantitatively capture teachers' attitudes, knowledge, and application of educational robotics. The six-phase development process, encompassing design, construction, quantitative evaluation, and validation, ensures the precision of the instrument. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on data from 307 preschool and primary school teachers extracts a 49-item, five-factor model. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) cross-validates the model, yielding satisfactory fits (CMIN/DF = 2.145, RMR = .60, PNFI = .683, PCFI = .784, CFI = .827, RMSEA = .061, SRMR = .0852). AKAER's reliability, assessed by Cronbach's Alpha coefficient (alpha = .929), indicates high internal consistency. Overall, these results affirm the reliability and validity of the constructed instrument, confirming its suitability for data collection. This validation positions the instrument as a potential catalyst for advancing research understanding and stimulating educational innovations in the teaching and utilization of educational robotics.","Gavrilas, Leonidas Kotsis, Konstantinos T.",,"Gavrilas, L Kotsis, KT",,"[Gavrilas, Leonidas; Kotsis, Konstantinos T.] Univ Ioannina, Dept Primary Educ, Ioannina 45110, Greece.",University of Ioannina,,,,,2025-01-19,Survey instrument; educational robotics; attitudes; knowledge; application,10.1080/1743727X.2024.2358780,Article; Early Access,MAY 2024,1743-7288,l.gavrilas@uoi.gr,,,,,RV9Q7,SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY; TEACHERS; PERCEPTIONS; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; SOFTWARE; VALIDITY; SCHOOLS; QUALITY; IMPACT,,INT J RES METHOD EDU,Int.

"Issues of global and local importance such as climate change and homelessness require critical perspectives across multiple disciplines including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Our paper brings critical mathematics education and social justice alongside STEM education to explore experiences of learning to teach. We focus specifically on learning to teach through creating mathematics problems in/for STEM and social justice. As a collaborative research group we are from five countries with varied cultural backgrounds, teaching experiences, and academic pathways. Dialogue as method is used to examine experiences of creating problems through which students can interpret and transform the world. Data collected included 46 h of audio-recorded dialogue meetings, 26 developed problems, and 7 interviews with 12 students. Results indicate creating mathematics problems in/for STEM involved navigating between mathematics, social justice, and STEM across all education levels and is supported with critical dialogue across cultural perspectives, diverse experiences, and expertise. Challenges lived include questioning the content of mathematics and STEM, deepening our own expertise to draw upon local and global problem contexts, and interrogating who benefits from such problems. Our study highlights the need for continued collaborative dialogue that not only gathers educators across disciplines but also includes students as co-creators of mathematics problems that could change their relationship with the world.","Nicol, Cynthia Bragg, Leicha A.

"The interrelationship of science and engineering and the recent inclusion of engineering in K-12 science standards have promoted the incorporation of engineering design in science classrooms. However, empirical studies on the impacts of engineering design on science learning show mixed findings and indicate that factors such as the complexity of design tasks, a lack of connections between design tasks and the underlying science concepts, and the limited experience with engineering among science teachers can influence learning gains from design activities. One useful approach for addressing these challenges is through the use of technologies such as interactive simulations, which have become increasingly prevalent in STEM education. In the present study, we used a simulation to investigate the effects of task context (science vs. engineering) on students' investigation behaviors and their understanding of science concepts. Furthermore, considering the relative novelty and complexity of an engineering context to many students, we examined how structuring students' responses in the engineering context affects their behaviors and learning. A total of 349 high school students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: science, structured engineering, and unstructured engineering. In the science condition, students used the simulation to investigate the effects of four variables on the saturation concentration of solutions. Using the same simulation, students in the structured and unstructured engineering conditions were directed to recommend the optimal variable values that meet a set of given constraints and maximize the saturation concentration for a commercial product. The only difference between the two engineering conditions was whether structuring was provided in the response fields presented to students as they entered responses for the target variables. Results suggested that the engineering context stimulated students to engage in more comprehensive investigation behaviors as compared to the science context. In contrast, students in the science condition exhibited more systematic behaviors. However, the increased comprehensiveness of behaviors in the engineering conditions did not translate into significantly greater learning of the science content in these conditions, indicating that students might have focused on the surface features associated with the engineering goal without making deep connections between the two domains. Furthermore, structuring students' responses within an engineering context as used in the current study did not lead to significant differences in investigation behaviors or learning outcomes.","Jiang, Yang Brockway, Debra Moon, Jung Aa",,"Jiang, Y Brockway, D Moon, JA",1292,"[Jiang, Yang; Brockway, Debra; Moon, Jung Aa] Educ Testing Serv, 660 Rosedale Rd, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA.

"Introduction: Central American countries, like many others, face a shortage of rural health physicians. Most medical schools in this region are located in urban areas and focus on tertiary care training rather than on community health or primary care, which are better suited for rural practice. However, many countries require young physicians to do community service in rural communities to address healthcare provider shortages. This study aimed to: (a) synthesize what is known about the current state of medical education preparing physicians for rural practice in this region, and (b) identify common needs, challenges and opportunities for improving medical education in this area. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted between December 2013 and May 2014. The stepwise, reproducible search process included English and Spanish language resources from both data-based web search engines (PubMed, Web of Science/Web of Knowledge, ERIC and Google Scholar) and the grey literature. Search criteria included MeSH terms: 'medical education', 'rural health', 'primary care', 'community medicine', 'social service', in conjunction with 'Central America', 'Latin America', 'Mexico', 'Guatemala', 'Belize', 'El Salvador', 'Nicaragua', 'Honduras', 'Costa Rica' and 'Panama'. Articles were included in the review if they (1) were published after 1984; (2) focused on medical education for rural health, primary care, community health; and (3) involved the countries of interest. A narrative synthesis of the content of resources meeting inclusion criteria was done using qualitative research methods to identify common themes pertaining to the study goals. Results: The search revealed 20 resources that met inclusion criteria. Only four of the 20 were research articles; therefore, information about this subject was primarily derived from expert opinion. Thematic analysis revealed the historical existence of several innovative programs that directly address rural medicine training needs, suggesting that expertise is present in this region. However, numerous challenges limit sustainability or expansion of successful programs. Common challenges include: (a) physicians' exposure to rural medicine primarily takes place during social service commitment time, rather than during formal medical training; (b) innovative educational programs are often not sustainable due to financial and leadership challenges; (c) the majority of physician manpower is in urban areas, resulting in few rural physician role models and teachers; and (d) there is insufficient collaboration to establish clinical and educational systems to meet rural health needs. Recurring suggestions for curricular changes include: (a) making primary care training a core component of medical school education; and (b) expanding medical school curricula in crosscultural communication and social determinants of disease. Suggestions for health system changes include: (a) improving living and working conditions for rural physicians; and (b) establishing partnerships between educational, governmental and non-governmental organizations and rural community leadership, to promote rural health training and systems. Conclusions: Expertise in rural medicine and training exists in continental Central America. However, there are numerous challenges to improving medical education to meet the needs of rural communities. Overcoming these challenges will require creative solutions, new partnerships, and evaluation and dissemination of successful educational programs. There is a great need for further research on this topic.","Colon-Gonzalez, M. C. El Rayess, F. Guevara, S.

"As the field of hydrologic sciences continues to advance, there is an increasing need to develop a workforce with tools to curate, manage, and analyze large datasets. As such, undergraduate and graduate curricula are beginning to regularly incorporate scientific programing in the classroom. However, there are several key challenges to successfully incorporating scientific programming into a hydrology course or curriculum, such as meeting disciplinary outcomes alongside teaching students to code, equity issues with access to computing power, and effective classroom management. While these challenges were exacerbated by the global pandemic, shifting to online and hybrid learning formats provided an opportunity to explore and re-evaluate the way we facilitated our hydrology courses and integrated coding exercises and learning. In this article, we reflect on these experiences in three very different hydrology courses (e.g., courses housed in geoscience/engineering, environmental science, and biology programs) with an eye toward identifying successes and opportunities for improvement. We explore this by presenting ten best management practices (BMPs), representing a series of recommendations we have for teaching a virtual, hybrid, or in-person hydrology course that incorporates coding. While all recommendations provided can be applied to many programming languages, the focus of the paper (given the expertise of the authors) is on R. Our BMPs focus on technological facilitation, managing the virtual classroom, and instructional resources, with lessons learned that are applicable to in-person instruction. We also summarize the ways that the authors of this article integrate coding into our coursework to serve as a framework for prepping new courses or those revising existing hydrologic coursework. Above all, we hope these series of recommendations will evolve as hydrology courses continue to emphasize computational skills alongside disciplinary learning.","Kelleher, Christa A. Gannon, John P.

"This review examines the didactic use of nature experiences in science education, in primary and secondary school (7-16 years) globally. From the perspective of embodied cognition the review explores the types of nature experiences used in science teaching. Focus is on returns when we invest in nature-based science learning, such as specific academic achievements in the form of long-term effects on learning and memory and how we maximize those returns. The review also addresses challenges and barriers, such as costs and labour involved when using nature experiences in science teaching. Initially, 3,659 articles were selected, with the initial screening leading to the inclusion of 159 studies. Of these articles, 34 studies forming the corpus in this review investigated the effect of using nature experiences as an intervention. These studies are divided into four themes: content understanding, environmental education, teaching scientific methods, and costs and challenges to teaching science outdoors. Informed by the perspective of embodied cognition, the review addresses the returns in terms of learning and academic achievements, the mode of action of the intervention, the investment, costs in the form of labour, challenges, and gaps in the theoretical underpinning of the field. Based on the review, using nature experiences in science education seems promising regarding increasing content knowledge, insight into science methodologies and pro-environmental behaviours. Interventions exploiting the schoolyard, school gardens, or nearby park areas are particularly promising due to the simultaneous strengthening of local engagement at low costs. However, using nature experiences as an alternative to traditional in-class teaching depends on profound didactic deliberations and preparations, which are difficult for the individual teacher to address single-handedly. The review also reveals an urgent need for research that thoroughly explores the connections between teaching practices and theoretical foundations to consolidate the field. To that end, it is noteworthy that a few studies also reported on prior pilot studies demonstrating the need for testing the entire design before conducting the actual research. Teachers seldom experience the opportunity to preview their teaching strategies before performing in front of their students.","Schilhab, Theresa",739408,"Schilhab, T",,"[Schilhab, Theresa] Aarhus Univ, Danish Sch Educ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",Aarhus University,,,,,2025-01-19,nature experience; science education; primary and secondary school education; content knowledge; environmental education (EE); review (article); nature connectedness; embodied cognition,10.3389/feduc.2021.739408,Review,,2504-284X,tsc@edu.au.dk,,,Nordea-fonden [02-2017-1293],Funding This research was supported by a grant from Nordea-fonden to TS to the research project Natural Technology (02-2017-1293).,YF7BM,TERM ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION; CITIZEN SCIENCE; STUDENTS; ATTITUDES; BIODIVERSITY; KNOWLEDGE; OUTDOORS; REPRESENTATIONS; ACHIEVEMENT; PSYCHOLOGY,,FRONT EDUC,Front.

"Active learning in STEM education is essential for engaging the diverse pool of scholars needed to address pressing environmental and social challenges. However, active learning formats are difficult to scale and their incorporation into STEM teaching at U.S. universities varies widely. Here, we argue that urban agriculture as a theme can significantly increase active learning in undergraduate biology education by facilitating outdoor fieldwork and community-engaged education. We begin by reviewing benefits of field courses and community engagement activities for undergraduate biology and discuss constraints to their broader implementation. We then describe how urban agriculture can connect biology concepts to pressing global changes, provide field research opportunities, and connect students to communities. Next, we assess the extent to which urban agriculture and related themes have already been incorporated into biology-related programs in the United States using a review of major programs, reports on how campus gardens are used, and case studies from five higher education institutions (HEIs) engaging with this issue. We found that while field experiences are fairly common in major biology programs, community engagement opportunities are rare, and urban agriculture is almost nonexistent in course descriptions. We also found that many U.S. HEIs have campus gardens, but evidence suggests that they are rarely used in biology courses. Finally, case studies of five HEIs highlight innovative programming but also significant opportunities for further implementation. Together, our results suggest that urban agriculture is rarely incorporated into undergraduate biology in the United States, but there are significant prospects for doing so. We end with recommendations for integrating urban agriculture into undergraduate biology, including the development of campus gardens, research programs, community engagement partnerships, and collaborative networks. If done with care, this integration could help students make community contributions within required coursework, and help instructors feel a greater sense of accomplishment in an era of uncertainty.","Kay, Adam D.

"The debate on the effects of Multi Track Year-Round Education (MT-YRE) on educational outcomes remains unresolved in the conventional literature. Nevertheless, Ghana has introduced an MT-YRE in 400 schools to allow graduates from Junior High Schools, who for space constraints, would not have continued their formal educational journey, to enrol in Senior High Schools. The purpose of this study was to examine the prospects and challenges of the MT-YRE on educational outcomes and discuss their implications for educational policy in Ghana. The data used in the study were obtained through a review of literature from databases such as the Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), Ebsco, ProQuest and JSTOR and from grey sources such as institutional websites and online media publications. The results from a synthesis of the literature show that the MT-YRE has the prospects of increasing student enrolment while cutting down the cost of infrastructure provision. For instance, the literature indicates that student enrolment at the Senior High School level in Ghana has increased significantly with the introduction of the MT-YRE. However, other literature indicate that the MT-YRE affects educational outcomes negatively. It results in scheduling difficulties among families and denies students the opportunities to take summer jobs. A review of the Ghanaian MT-YRE reveals other challenges, which inlcude high administrative cost (employing more teachers) and poor academic performance of students (as a result of increased contact hours leading to behavioural problems caused by fatigue and boredom). The authors argue that poor academic performance among students is likely to defeat the government's Free SHS policy. This is because parents are likely to pay higher fees to enrol their non-performing wards in remedial classes. The cost of the lost years for these students may be difficult to quantify. Following the challenges identified, there is the need for educational policy makers to strategically plan towards the development of technical and vocational education to help accommodate the increasing students' enrolment. Finally, the progress of the MT-YRE should be carefully monitored and evaluated to guide future decision making.","Takyi, Stephen Appiah Azerigyik, Richard Apatewen Amponsah, Owusu",102120,"Takyi, SA Azerigyik, RA Amponsah, O",,"[Takyi, Stephen Appiah] Univ Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC, Canada.

This is especially important when educating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college students, since they may play a central role in the future of scientific research and its communication. A central part of decoding and interpreting scientific information is the ability to analyze scientific research articles. For this reason, many different approaches for reading scientific research articles have been developed and published. Despite the availability of numerous ways of analyzing scientific research articles, biology students can face challenges that may prevent them from fully comprehending the text. We sought to address student challenges with science vocabulary and content knowledge by adding structural supports to in-classroom article discussions through the use of annotated articles from the Science in the Classroom initiative. We describe the pedagogical approach used for discussing scientific research articles within a required biology course. In this context, we found that students' scientific literacy skills increased at the end of the semester. We also found that, for each article discussed, the majority of students could interpret graphical representations of article results and that they could identify and comprehend components of the experimental design of the study.","Washburn, Mary E.

"The animated children's television show, Doc McStuffins, may serve as an out-of-school multicultural STEM education platform for its young television audience. The lead character, as well as the supporting cast of toy characters, represents a variety of racial, ethnic, and cultural identities while modeling medicine and healthcare practices. A critical race sociological perspective recognizes that, in the U.S., racism and social stratification are endemic and this practice of culturally characterizing the toys is situated within a larger historical and sociopolitical context where different cultures, identities, and communities experience differences in power, privilege, and oppression. At times, toys were representative of communities that have historically endured oppression, e.g. communities of color, immigrant communities, and communities with low-income status. Furthermore, in the show, the doctor diagnoses and responds to medical challenges faced by the toy characters and these medical challenges were, at times, caused or exacerbated by the behavior or disposition of some of the toys themselves. Thus, toys were also variably characterized as exhibiting problematic healthcare behavior, while some toys exhibited positive healthcare behavior. Healthcare behavior was similarly located within an ideological context which has associated communities of color, especially those with low-income status, with irresponsible, self-destructive behavior and dependency, as well as an overburdened welfare state. Of concern was the intersection, especially disproportionately, of problematic healthcare behavior and toys representative of communities that have endured these and other related negative characterizations. Through counter-storytelling, the dominant narrative of the television show foregrounded in diversity is complicated to trace adaptive and resilient racial ideologies into new settings and structures. The ideological underpinnings and limitations of diversity itself in our current sociopolitical context are utilized to further examine the phenomenon within the television show.","Mark, Sheron L.",,"Mark, SL",955,"[Mark, Sheron L.] Univ Louisville, Coll Educ & Human Dev, 1905 S1st St, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",University of Louisville,,,,,2025-01-19,Critical race theory; Ideology; Diversity; STEM engagement and representation; Television media,10.1007/s11422-021-10096-y,Article,JAN 2022,1871-1510,sheron.mark@louisville.edu,981,,,,3Z1TI,WELFARE; IDEOLOGY; WOMEN; WORK; RACE,3,CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT,Cult.

"While extensive research has explored the impact of Augmented Reality (AR) on student perspectives, experiences, and outcomes, there remains a significant gap in empirical studies focusing on teachers' viewpoints, particularly within Science Education. Given that uncovering teachers' viewpoints is crucial for leveraging AR technology's potential in education since teachers decide whether to integrate it into their classrooms, the research question guiding this exploratory study is as follows: How do primary and pre-school teacher students perceive the integration of AR into Science teaching and learning following their engagement with pertinent university courses? Following a mixed-method approach, the data were collected via written questionnaires from 69 teacher students and focus group discussions involving 12 participants. Subsequent descriptive statistical and thematic analyses revealed that teacher students hold positive stances towards the integration of AR in Science Education. They emphasized that AR could significantly enhance motivational and cognitive outcomes for their future students while also improving accessibility and inclusion. Furthermore, their involvement in creating AR-enhanced materials not only increased course engagement and interest but also broadened their knowledge and fostered a sense of innovation, with the AR platform and application used being perceived as easy to use. Finally, challenges associated with classroom implementation were also highlighted.","Peikos, Giorgos Sofianidis, Angelos",480,"Peikos, G Sofianidis, A",,"[Peikos, Giorgos] Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Primary Educ, Florina 53100, Greece.

"Despite the importance of science education in the establishment, maintenance and support of a knowledge economy, the ensuing economic challenges facing Lesotho deprive schools and pupils of some important resources, namely laboratories and the associated accessories required for quality delivery of teaching. This manuscript reports on the results of a survey on the resources available for teaching chemistry at secondary schools in preparation for the introduction of an advanced level (A level) curriculum in Lesotho schools. The survey was administered to first-year students registered at the National University of Lesotho for different science-based degrees. The findings from the survey showed that about 90 % of the schools had physical laboratories although on average 70 % of the students reported not having performed more than five experiments over the last year of the secondary school education. Only two schools reported having performed between 15 and 20 experiments of the more than 20 prescribed in the syllabus. The reasons cited ranged from poor facilities, for example poor or no benchtops, no or unusable fumehoods, lack of general apparatus and glassware, a poor range of suitable chemicals, to interestingly, the experiments not even being scheduled in the timetables. The study concludes that the schools in Lesotho are not ready to offer A level chemistry and suggests some recommendations that could be considered should the introduction of A-level be implemented in the near future.","George, Mosotho J.",,"George, MJ",154,"[George, Mosotho J.] Natl Univ Lesotho, Dept Chem & Chem Technol, PO Roma 180, Roma, Lesotho.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Chemistry education; laboratory experiments; A-level; secondary schools; Lesotho,10.17159/0379-4350/2017/v70a22,Article,,1996-840X,jm.george@nul.ls,162,,,,GA4PX,,,S AFR J CHEM-S-AFR T,South Afr.

"The use of hypermedia environments is increasing in school education. The interactivity in hypermedia environments challenges learners to autonomously navigate such environments. Particularly in multiperspective hypermedia environments (MHEs), which emphasize the multiperspectivity of a topic, it is important to apply navigational behaviors that take advantage of this information structure through which different perspectives can be selected and compared. However, we argue that and test whether the availability of sufficient spatial working memory (WM) resources is an important precondition for effectively engaging in this type of perspective processing. Specifically, we examined N = 97 German fourth-graders' navigational behaviors (i.e., perspective processing, content processing, and irrelevant processing) during hypermedia learning and their relation to spatial WM and performance. To this end, we developed an MHE on the biodiversity of 24 fish species. Participants' navigational behavior was determined via log file analyses, while their performance was assessed by exploration questions and inferential questions (about fish) and by scientific transfer questions (about the biodiversity of another species). Our results indicated that spatial WM was positively related to perspective processing, which was positively related to performance. Mediation analyses revealed that perspective processing partially explained the relation between spatial WM and performance. Thus, both spatial WM and perspective processing are important for benefitting from MHEs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to higher education. The transition to distance education was sudden and unplanned, so we use the term ""Emergency Remote Teaching"" (ERT) for the form of distance learning we used. This article is about the first results of the TAVOK 2020 research conducted at the Faculty of Primary and Pre-School Education of Eatvos Lorand University, describes the technical conditions of distance learning, the benefits and difficulties of online learning for students, the characteristics of home learning, the attributes of social factors and students' effective learning needs. In the questionnaire survey, 609 people (36% of students at the Faculty) provided feedback on his/her experiences of the first month of distance education. As an advantage of distance education, students mentioned flexible scheduling, the convenience of learning at home, and the opportunity for self-development. Significant difficulties were encountered in three areas: (1) personal relationships and communication, (2) self-regulated learning, and (3) technical problems. Online classes and consultations were important for the students, where synchronous communication created a more realistic learning experience. Effective communication, learning support, clear, transparent requirements and teachers' flexibility play a key role in effective distance learning. The quality of education will continue to depend on human factors: on mutual respect, helpful support, acceptance and understanding of each other; the technical conditions are necessary but not sufficient.","Serfozo, Monika Golyan, Szilvia Lassu, F.

"Background: Problem-based learning (PBL) is a form of constructivist learning that allows learners to use higher order thinking by promoting learners to construct their own knowledge and understanding. PBL is prevalent in medical school education, but literature on PBL in graduate medical education (GME) is lacking. Because of the limited amount of data on PBL curricula inGMEand the need for young physicians to develop critical thinking, lifelong self-directed learning, and problem-solving skills, we sought to incorporate PBL into the curriculum for our internal medicine residency program in a university-based community hospital setting. Methods: The PBL committee created 4 cases derived from actual patient encounters that address common chief complaints encountered in the hospital and served as a crash course curriculum for interns in internal medicine. The success of the PBL curriculum was measured using a 39-question survey created by PBL leadership to assess the learners' satisfaction with case content, likeability/design, feasibility, effectiveness, and motivation/self-learning. Additional questions asked for ways to improve PBL sessions in the future. Results: Overall, interns felt the content was clinically relevant, challenged them to think critically, and aided in the medical management of their patients. They also found PBL to be more effective and more enjoyable than the traditional lecture-style curriculum. Conclusion: Implementing a PBL curriculum in a residency program is possible. Although PBL has associated challenges such as scheduling, it is well received when supported by the program.","Ardoin, Tiffany Wesley Hamer, Diana Stumpf, Michael Miles, Lauren",,"Ardoin, TW Hamer, D Stumpf, M Miles, L",324,"[Ardoin, Tiffany Wesley; Stumpf, Michael] Louisiana State Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Clin Med, 5246 Brittany Dr,4th Fl, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA.

"Background Persons living with HIV (PLWH) are living into old age with more complex care needs that non-PLWH. Promoting quality of life should include advance care planning (ACP) education, particularly among African Americans. We explored faith/spirituality-related correlates of interest in a future quality of life program among African American PLWH. Methods Data were from the AFFIRM study. Participants were recruited from an HIV clinic and completed surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Quantitative analyses included Logistic regression. Qualitative data were coded using grounded theory. Results Nearly half of participants had less than a high school education (47.9%), and roughly 90% had heard of at least one ACP-related topic (86.6%;N = 315). Qualitative themes related to quality of life and faith/spirituality were: (1) Coping with life challenges; (2) Motivation to improve health for loved ones; and (3) Support programs for people with HIV (N = 39). Satisfaction with religion/spirituality was associated with greater interest in a future program (p < .05); discussing ACP before getting sick was associated with less interest (p < .05). Conclusions/practice implications Prioritizing skill-building and grounding in spirituality with input from faith leaders can reduce ACP inequities and improve health outcomes among African Americans.","Maragh-Bass, Allysha C.

"The purpose of this text is to discuss the relationship between the historical, social and educational movement of the Inclusive Education in Brazil and the proposal of Historical-Critical Pedagogy as pedagogical praxis, in the sense of understanding and overcoming the generalized school exclusion, still present in our country. For Historical-Critical Pedagogy, the overcoming of class society and the inequalities produced by it is a fundamental condition for human diversity to be fully and radically accomplished. From the reality of the Inclusive Education in Brazil, its deadlocks and its achievements, the text addresses the challenges and possibilities of human formation with a school for all, in classrooms that must effectively meet the singularities of its students towards the domain of knowledge that humanity developed and science, philosophy and the arts systematized. Then, it is reflected, on the grounds of the Historical-Cultural Psychology, that a revolutionary pedagogical theory must mediate, through the work of culture, the mental development of individuals, promoting leaps in quality in human development. The text ends by pointing out the opposition to what the ""School without Parties Projects"" proposes, which seek to restrict and eliminate the debate of ideas and the possibilities of plural thinking.

"This article presents the main contents, methods, and results of the European project EDUSCAPE (Erasmus+) developed by a team of international researchers from four countries, just over a year and a half after its launch with a focus on SAAD/UNICAM contributions. Into the scientific-disciplinary frame of environmental education and climate adaptation, EDUSCAPE aims to integrate the polysemic, transversal, and multidisciplinary concept of landscape and its decline, as a promoter of new forms of knowledge in response to emerging dynamics, within the educational offer of school programs (6-15 years). This paper presents the general structure of the project, the methodology experimented (PBL educational approach), and the qualitative and quantitative intermediate results obtained so far (literature review, curriculum analysis, and needs analysis). To integrate landscape into school curricula and renew them, EDUSCAPE is preparing Didactic Units (DUs) as the final result of the project to provide theoretical foundations and practical solutions supporting teaching which will be tested in the schools of the partnership network. In general, this paper explores the possibility to disseminate the pedagogical and social role of the landscape through a new way of teaching based on a deeper exploration of the theme that can stimulate critical thinking in current and future generations regarding the global/local challenges of the 21st century.","Caprari, Giorgio D'Onofrio, Rosalba Grifoni, Roberta Cocci Pellegrino, Piera Simionato, Ludovica Trusiani, Elio",790,"Caprari, G D'Onofrio, R Grifoni, RC Pellegrino, P Simionato, L Trusiani, E",,"[Caprari, Giorgio; D'Onofrio, Rosalba; Grifoni, Roberta Cocci; Pellegrino, Piera; Simionato, Ludovica; Trusiani, Elio] Univ Camerino, Sch Architecture & Design SAAD, Viale Rimembranza Snc, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy.",University of Camerino,,,,,2025-01-19,landscape; climate change adaptation; landscape and environmental education; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); project-based learning (PBL); problem-based learning (PBL); Erasmus plus project,10.3390/su16020790,Article,,2071-1050,giorgio.caprari@unicam.it; rosalba.donofrio@unicam.it; piera.pellegrino@unicam.it; ludovica.simionato@unicam.it; elio.trusiani@unicam.it,,,EDUSCAPE project-Landscape and Climate Change Adaptation in Education-Erasmus+ KA220-SCH-Cooperation partnerships in school education [2021-1-CZ01-KA220-SCH-000027939],"This research was funded by EDUSCAPE project-Landscape and Climate Change Adaptation in Education-Erasmus+ KA220-SCH-Cooperation partnerships in school education, grantagreement number 2021-1-CZ01-KA220-SCH-000027939",GF2M0,,2,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,English,,51,"Green Published, gold","Caprari, Giorgio/0000-0002-9263-8292; , rosalba/0000-0003-3630-579X; Cocci Grifoni, Roberta/0000-0002-7092-6293","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",JAN,20,BASEL,,,J,MDPI,2024,"D'onofrio, Rosalba/Y-8202-2019","Caprari, G; Pellegrino, P (corresponding author), Univ Camerino, Sch Architecture & Design SAAD, Viale Rimembranza Snc, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy.",Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,SUSTAINABILITY,,,0,"Landscape, Environmental Sustainability, and Climate Instability-The EDUSCAPE Project: University Research for Innovation in School Education",3,8,WOS:001151184900001,16,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),0
"The Escola da Terra Program is a State policy, involving the federal government, state and municipal governments, as well as social movements and Public Higher Education Institutions. It seeks to promote specific continuous formation of teachers to meet the needs of rural and quilombola schools. This article aims to report and analyze contributions of the Improvement Course Escola da Terra at UFT, Arraias Campus, in the formation of rural teachers in Tocantins, having as reference the Module: Mathematical Languages. We analyzed materials produced by course participants, contents and methodologies addressed in the formation. The investigation uses as a research instrument the field reports of the professionals involved in the project. The data were analyzed in the light of the theoretical framework that deals with rural education, ethnomathematics, sociocultural practices and initial and continuing teacher formation. We highlight the elaboration of the action projects of the course participants, the result of reflections on the contents discussed during online meetings and materialized in the community time in the schools where they work. Although there are many challenges, we recognize that the Project (UFT) and the Program (MEC) Escola da Terra have triggered formation processes, which seek to build spaces for dialogue and reflection on educational practices based on their contexts, in line with the principles of Rural Education.","de Carvalho, Raquel Alves Khidir, Kaled Sulaiman Coelho, Rogerio Ribeiro",e13897,"de Carvalho, RA Khidir, KS Coelho, RR",,"[de Carvalho, Raquel Alves] Univ Fed Grande Doutorados UFGD, Fac Intercultural Indigena, Rodovia Dourados Itahum,Km 12 Unidade 2, BR-79804970 Dourados, MS, Brazil.

"Background: To measure socioeconomic inequalities in maternal health services in rural western China and to analyze the determinants' contributions of inequalities. Study design: a cross-sectional study. Methods: The data utilized in this study were obtained from a cross-sectional study from 10 provinces in rural Western China in 2005. Wealth index of household socioeconomic status was developed by using principle component analysis. Concentration index, concentration curve and decomposition of the concentration index were employed to measure socioeconomic inequality in maternal health services utilization. Results: For more than four times prenatal visits, the concentration index was 0.0605 (95% CI: 0.0603, 0.0607). The concentration index of hospital delivery was 0.0230 (95% CI: 0.0210, 0.0240) and the concentration index of more than 2 times postnatal visits was 0.0842 (95% CI: 0.0836, 0.0847). Han ethnicity woman, particularly in conjunction with high school education and rich wealth status, was the main contributor to inequality in maternal health services utilization. Conclusions: There is a strong pro-rich inequality of maternal health services in rural western China. This study suggests that an effective way to reduce the inequality is not only to narrow the gap of income between the rich and poor, but focus education on ethnic minority woman in rural remote areas.","Liu, Xiaoning Gao, Wenlong Yan, Hong",102,"Liu, XN Gao, WL Yan, H",,"[Liu, Xiaoning; Gao, Wenlong; Yan, Hong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Coll Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

"The city of Houston, Texas has a growing deficit of available and affordable rental units for low-income residents. Due to pet policies, the shortage of affordable housing potentially puts renters who own pets at greater risk of housing insecurity. In this qualitative study, we use a community-engaged approach to document the lived experiences of finding and maintaining affordable housing among 24 current, former, and aspiring pet owners. The majority of the participants identified as female, were aged 44-60 years, identified as Black, had a high school education, and were employed full-time or on disability or government assistance. Many expressed having experienced homelessness in the past and/or having lived in several different types of affordable housing over their lifetime. Participants highlighted challenges in finding pet-inclusive affordable housing, emphasized its importance, and discussed issues faced, such as high pet charges, size and breed restrictions, and confusion surrounding pet policies. Landlord relationships and living conditions varied, with safety concerns prevalent. Having one's pet designated as an Emotional Support Animal made tenants feel safe and secure, knowing they could not be refused, evicted, or otherwise charged extra. Participants shared what is working well and what could be improved. This study concludes with recommendations for fair application and awareness of pet policies in affordable housing, drawing on participating tenants' experiences and existing efforts for policy and practice improvements.","Mascitelli, Tess M.

"Japanese community is falling apart. This is caused by the combination of two problems: on the one hand, people are feeling their existence to be less and less stable and their reality is being shaken; on the other hand, the sense of values in the society is becoming more and more diversified and fluid. In the background of the two problems are three issues facing society: the rapidly declining birth rate and aging and dwindling population; the prolonged economic depression and destabilised employment; and the destruction of communal ties among inhabitants due to change in grassroots communities and the increasing isolation of individuals comprising the so-called no-bondage society. What is attracting more and more attention by policymakers addressing the two crises is lifelong learning. Challenges facing lifelong learning in Japan do not simply mean the acquisition of competency as often discussed in Western countries. More importantly, they are about how we can link learning activities to the formation of a new community. What is required of us is to seek how we can build up a community that creates a constant equilibrium by being dynamic, ensures the lifestyle of community residents by changing itself and recognises their human dignity. Learning' no longer means distributing rights to education through a uniform system like school education. Now, it means the style of residents' existence to create a new community. There, learning' has become the government's critical task in the field of residents' autonomy.","Makino, Atsushi",,"Makino, A",42,"Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan.",University of Tokyo,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1080/03050068.2012.740219,Article,,,makino@p.u-tokyo.ac.jp,56,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530993, 23243080] Funding Source: KAKEN",,100FS,,1,COMP EDUC,Comp.

"Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease among school-going adolescents worldwide. However, the burden of severe asthma is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to explore teachers' perceptions of asthma care across six African countries. We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. FGDs were conducted in Kumasi(Ghana), Blantyre (Malawi), Lagos (Nigeria), Durban (South Africa), Kampala (Uganda), and Harare (Zimbabwe) between 01 November 2020 and 30 June 2021. We identified two key themes related to asthma care; barriers to asthma care and suggestions to improve the care of adolescents with asthma. Barriers reported by teachers included a lack of knowledge and skills among themselves, adolescents, and caregivers. In addition, some traditional beliefs of teachers on asthma exacerbated challenges with asthma care in schools. Regarding suggestions, most teachers identified a need for all-inclusive asthma training programmes for teachers, adolescents and caregivers, focusing on acute episodes and mitigating triggers. Utilising teachers with personal experiences with asthma to advocate and support these initiatives was suggested. Further suggestions included the need for annual screening to enable early identification of adolescents with asthma and clarify restrictions on teachers administering asthma medications. Teachers across African schools identify multiple barriers to asthma care. Structured school education programs and annual asthma screening are key to addressing some barriers to care.","Naidoo, Kimesh Loganathan Dladla, Sindisiwa Mphahlele, Reratilwe Ephenia Mosler, Gioia Muyemayema, Sophie Ssemata, Andrew Sentoogo Mkutumula, Elizabeth Adeyeye, Olayinka Olufunke Goodman, Olayinka Kuyinu, Yetunde Nantanda, Rebecca Addo-Yobo, Emmanuel Owusu, Sandra Kwarteng Arhin, Bernhard Ticklay, Ismail Mujuru, Hilda Angela Grigg, Jonathan Masekela, Refiloe",31,"Naidoo, KL Dladla, S Mphahlele, RE Mosler, G Muyemayema, S Ssemata, AS Mkutumula, E Adeyeye, OO Goodman, O Kuyinu, Y Nantanda, R Addo-Yobo, E Owusu, SK Arhin, B Ticklay, I Mujuru, HA Grigg, J Masekela, R",,"[Naidoo, Kimesh Loganathan; Dladla, Sindisiwa; Mphahlele, Reratilwe Ephenia; Masekela, Refiloe] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Hlth Sci, Sch Clin Med, Dept Paediat & Child Hlth, Durban, South Africa.

"During Pandemic, the education has become little difficult for children. Family and professional collaboration is salutary to scholars, families, and preceptors. The significance of similar collaboration was honoured for families of scholars with disabilities, performing in vittles' in the Individualities with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that dictate maternal participation in educational planning. Despite the benefits of family and professional collaboration and the IDEA accreditation, numerous parents differ with the educational planning opinions handed to their children and request due process sounds. Parents perceive a lack of occasion to give input and/or to differ with seminaries' perspectives. Parents of early nonage scholars report significant enterprises about their child's readiness for the transition to kindergarten and their limited part in transition planning as their children prepared to enter preschool programs. The purpose of this paper was to examine the issues linked in maternal complaints in early childhood special education (ECSE) through a qualitative content analysis of recent courtcases.Childhood and adolescence are without mistrustfulness the most important phase of one's experimental life, which is why focus on internal and physical well-being is the only way to insure holistic development. Internationally, several developed and developing nations have espoused wide- grounded internal healthcare practices in educational institutions. It's time for India to pay attention to this aspect of its public health problem.","Bhushan, Tripti Russel, Langpoklakpam Nehru Narayan, Ashish Bhargava, Akshay",,"Bhushan, T Russel, L Nehru Narayan, A Bhargava, A",1474,"[Bhushan, Tripti] Teaching & Res Intellectual Pursuit TRIPS, OP Jindal Global Law Sch, Sonipat, Haryana, India.

"Objectives: This study sought to estimate and characterize the proportion of California adults who visited a dentist in the preceding year and to identify reasons for not going. Methods: In 1995, 4,029 adults were interviewed by telephone as part of the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Items included recentness of a dental visit, dental insurance status, and number of teeth lost due to disease. Persons who had not seen a dentist within the preceding year were asked the main reason they had not gone. Results: In 1995, 65.9% of adults reported visiting a dentist in the preceding twelve months. Use of dental services was greater among persons aged 35 years or older (70.4%) than among those aged 18-34 years (58.4%) and among those with dental insurance (74.9%) than those without (54.4%). Dental visits were less likely among adults living at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, those with less than a high school education, and the edentulous. Reasons most commonly cited for not seeing a dentist were no perceived reason to go (37.2%), cost (30.7%), and fear (9.2%). Conclusion: Substantial variation in use of dental services exists among California's adults. Achieving equity in access and opportunity for disease prevention in this state may require expanded dental insurance coverage and serious efforts in oral health promotion.","Tomar, SL Azevedo, AB Lawson, R",,"Tomar, SL Azevedo, AB Lawson, R",275,"Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Dent, Dept Dent Publ Hlth & Hyg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.

"This is one of the initial studies investigating the educational challenges faced by ethnic minority migrant children in eastern China. Prior scholarship has well documented pressing issues relating to migrant children. However, there is limited research on ethnic minority migrant children, despite their growing presence in Chinese cities. Drawing from data collected during thirteen months of fieldwork with Hui and Salar migrant children in the Han-dominated city of Shanghai, this article illuminates the institutional and non-institutional exclusion they encounter during both school enrolment and integration. Enrolment policies impose severe restrictions on the ability of ethnic minority migrant children to access compulsory education in Shanghai. Beyond these institutional barriers, Hui and Salar children also face widespread exclusions and discrimination even after successfully enrolling in schools. In Shanghai state schools, including dedicated ethnic minority schools, appropriate formal support for minority migrant children is lacking. It thus falls to individual teachers to provide ad-hoc support for students, which may do more harm than good. Ethnic minority migrant children and their families respond to their disadvantageous situation in a variety of ways, depending on their circumstances, future plans, and understanding of their identity. Some Salar and Hui children are encouraged by parents to prioritise preserving their ethnic identities, forsaking opportunities for integration, while others are urged to assimilate with Han peers by relinquishing attempts to maintain distinct ethnic identities. These choices also influence their attitudes toward school education.","Dong, Yiming",103036,"Dong, YM",,"[Dong, Yiming] Kings Coll London, Dept Int Dev, London, England.",University of London; King's College London,,,,,2025-01-19,Ethnic minorities; Migrant children; Education; Migration; China,10.1016/j.ijedudev.2024.103036,Article,APR 2024,1873-4871,yiming.dong@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,RS2F0,SHANGHAI,,INT J EDUC DEV,Int.

"This article submits that while the world continues to view education as a human right, it also persists in depriving an important section of it - namely adult learning and education (ALE) - of adequate funding. Located within the lifelong learning domain, which facilitates both the resolution of challenges and adjustment to the vagaries of living throughout a lifetime, ALE is indispensable within the framework of the United Nations 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article identifies four factors which are currently responsible for the poor funding of ALE. These factors are: (1) the world's obsession with the provision of school education; (2) the lack of adequate instruments to work out ALE's returns on investment; (3) the hope that employers will ultimately supply ALE; and (4) the assumption that an expansion of formal schooling will eventually lead to the establishment of literate societies free of inter-generational crises. Since ALE is generally framed as a broad literacy education project, the author undertakes a review of literacy education costing. This leads him to posit that quality literacy education can be supplied at a unit cost ranging between USD 150 and USD 250 annually within any Global Alliance for Literacy (GAL) country. Finally, the article offers four recommendations to increase ALE funding going forward.","Biao, Idowu",,"Biao, I",213,"[Biao, Idowu] Univ dAbomey Calavi, Global Challenges Res Fund Projects, Abomey Calavi, Benin.",University of Abomey Calavi,,,,,2025-01-19,adult learning and education (ALE); funding adult learning and education (ALE); costing regimes; funding models; increasing adult learning and education (ALE) funding,10.1007/s11159-022-09950-0,Article,MAY 2022,1573-0638,idowubiao2014@gmail.com,231,,,,1T5GQ,TARGETS; UNESCO; GOAL,2,INT REV EDUC,Int.

"Introduction: This study aimed to identify factors associated with late diagnosis and clinically monitor newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients. Method: Retrospective study, based on secondary data from a specialized unit at the Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto of the University of Sao Paulo. Data collection included sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and laboratory data of newly diagnosed HIV patients between 2015 and 2019. Data analysis was undertaken using inferential statistical tests. Results: A total of 314 individuals were newly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, 86.6% (272) had a late diagnosis and 53.8% (169) were diagnosed very late. Using the adjusted odds ratio, we observed that bisexual and MSM patients were less likely to have a late diagnosis compared to straight patients. Individuals who entered through the emergency department and Outpatient Clinic had a lower chance of having a very late diagnosis compared to those diagnosed in the ward/inpatient unit. Having a higher education and university education were protective factors against having a very late diagnosis of HIV infection compared to elementary school education only. In addition, male patients were more likely to have a very late diagnosis compared to female patients. Conclusions: This study evidenced a high prevalence of late and very late diagnoses. Therefore, attention should be directed towards factors related to late and very late presentation.","Arantes, Ligia Maria Nascimento Pedroso, Andrey Oeiras Menegueti, Mayra Goncalves Gir, Elucir Botelho, Elia Pinheiro Silva, Ana Cristina de Oliveira e Reis, Renata Karina",2097,"Arantes, LMN Pedroso, AO Menegueti, MG Gir, E Botelho, EP Silva, ACDE Reis, RK",,"[Arantes, Ligia Maria Nascimento; Pedroso, Andrey Oeiras; Menegueti, Mayra Goncalves; Gir, Elucir; Reis, Renata Karina] Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Coll Nursing, BR-14040902 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.

"Background Homelessness is an expression and consequence of a complex problem situation that poses major challenges to the medical and social care systems in Germany. About three quarters of homeless people suffer from mental illness. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between mental illness and homelessness. Material and methods A secondary data analysis of patients' records from a Berlin health center for homeless people was conducted. Data from 112 homeless patients who received care at the center between the years 2006 and 2020 were included in the explorative study. Results Mental illness was present in 84.9% of patients before the onset of homelessness. The factors associated with an early onset of homelessness were low school education and drug abuse. A long duration of homelessness was associated with the factors alcohol abuse as well as imprisonment. Each new episode of street homelessness was associated with an average increase in the duration of homelessness by 7.9 months. Discussion Since mental illnesses are important factors influencing the development and maintenance of homelessness, preventive strategies as well as specialized services for this vulnerable group need to be increasingly created. In particular, recurring episodes of street homelessness should be prevented as far as possible. The link between imprisonment and homelessness suggests that more intensive support is needed for reintegration after release from prison.","Knoerle, Uwe Gutwinski, Stefan Willich, Stefan N.

"There is a notable shift towards prioritizing the teaching of engineering design within K-12 education, coupled with a strong recommendation for engineering design-based integrated STEM education. This approach underscores the sharing of science and engineering practices as a means to facilitate the learning of various STEM disciplines. Nonetheless, the implementation of integrated STEM education in rural schools poses challenges due to constrained resources and a shortage of high-quality programs. To present a tangible instance of design-based integrated STEM education within a rural setting, this study presents a model lesson that showcases the integration of interdisciplinary problem-solving skills within a genuine real-world context. This study examined how teacher collaboration for engineering and science shared practices influenced students' design process. Concurrent Think-Aloud (CTA) protocol data and design sketches produced by the student design teams during the protocol sessions display how they elicited their design thinking skills and STEM domain knowledge acquired from the integrated STEM lesson in an engineering design task. This study found that the students learned the model lesson through the fully integrated instruction between students and teachers utilized more balanced design cognitions than the silo approach of integration. The findings highlight that the utilization of engineering design in K-12 education to cultivate integrated problem-solving skills should be accompanied by domain-integrated instructions for effective implementation. On denote un changement remarquable en ce qui concerne la priorite accordee a l'enseignement de la conception technique dans l'education primaire et secondaire, et on voit se former une forte recommandation en faveur d'un enseignement integre des STIM fonde sur la conception technique. Cette approche met l'accent sur le partage des pratiques scientifiques et d'ingenierie comme moyen de faciliter l'apprentissage des differentes disciplines des STIM. Cependant, la mise en oe uvre de l'enseignement integre des STIM dans les ecoles en milieu rural pose des defis en raison des ressources limitees et du manque de programmes releves. Afin de montrer un exemple concret d'enseignement integre des STIM fonde sur la conception dans un contexte rural, cette etude presente des approches et methodes modeles qui mettent en valeur l'integration de competences interdisciplinaires en matiere de resolution de problemes dans un contexte concret et authentique. Dans cette etude, on a examine comment la collaboration des enseignants pour les pratiques partagees en matiere d'ingenierie et de sciences a influence le processus de conception des eleves. Les donnees generees par le protocole de verbalisation de la pensee simultanee (VPS) et les esquisses creees par les equipes de conception formees d'eleves lors des seances conformes au protocole montrent comment les eleves ont fait appel a leurs competences en matiere de reflexion en ce qui a trait a la conception ainsi qu'a leurs connaissances du domaine des STIM, acquises par le biais d'un enseignement integre des STIM dans la realisation d'une tache de conception technique. Cette etude indique que les eleves apprennent les approches et methodes modeles par un enseignement qui est totalement integre entre les apprenants et les enseignants et qu'ils utilisent des processus cognitifs en matiere de conception qui sont plus equilibres que dans le cas de l'approche d'integration faite en cloisonnement. Les resultats revelent qu'afin d'obtenir une mise en oe uvre efficace, l'utilisation de la conception technique dans l'enseignement de la maternelle a la 12e annee pour cultiver les competences integrees de resolution de problemes devrait etre accompagnee d'instructions integrees portant sur le domaine.","Han, Jung Sung, Euisuk Kelley, Todd Knowles, John Geoffrey",,"Han, J Sung, ES Kelley, T Knowles, JG",591,"[Han, Jung; Kelley, Todd] Purdue Univ, Dept Technol Leadership Innovat, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.

"Few studies in science education have examined how place-based experiences influence students' STEM career aspirations. Rural school students' lived experiences of place and non-traditional STEM career aspirations such as farming are scarcely considered in dominant narratives around science aspirations and career pathways. Adopting a critical relational perspective that considers place as a lived experience we ask How do rural Australian students' ethnogeographies related to people and place influence their STEM career aspirations? Drawing on a broader study (n = 45) of science aspirations, we focus on semi-structured interviews with six middle school students (13-14 years of age) in rural Australia who aspire to be farmers. Thematic analysis of the data demonstrates students' intended careers as farmers relate to their connections to people and belonging to place. This article works through rural-urban binaries to present a counternarrative that legitimises farming as an important STEM career for young people and challenges dominant narratives around post-compulsory participation in senior secondary school and tertiary science as the ideal or only career pathway. Finally, implications of our findings for designing place-conscious school science education are discussed. This includes place-attentive strategies related to policy, pathways, and practice that appreciate the complex realities, strengths, and inequities in rural communities.","Mills, Reece Scholes, Laura Stahl, Garth McDonald, Sarah Comber, Barbara Brownlee, Jo Lunn",,"Mills, R Scholes, L Stahl, G McDonald, S Comber, B Brownlee, JL",2333,"[Mills, Reece; Brownlee, Jo Lunn] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Educ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.

"Over the last decade, education has been evolving to equip students with the fundamental skills required to cope with the challenges of sustainability and inclusivity, such as quality education, access to clean water, cultural heritage preservation and protection of marine life. Technology supports the learning process by providing useful tools that enrich the learning environment, encourage active participation, improve collaboration and prepare students for their future life. Educational Robotics is one of the most popular innovative methodologies that supports the development of many skills by assembling and programming robots in a meaningful way. In this paper, the authors aim at advancing their previous work in the field of Educational Robotics applied to the marine environment by proposing a novel bioinspired educational toolkit whose design and features support activities concerning sustainability, ocean literacy, as well as STEM subjects in kindergarten through to grade twelve education. Exploiting the established educational theories and methodologies underpinning Educational Robotics, the toolkit allows for marine-themed activities, as well promoting activities concerning STEM subjects. To explain the relevance of the toolkit, the authors present the robot design, the workshops that every teacher or student can explore as an Open Educational Resource (OERs), and the results of a case study. Interestingly, the latter shows that the use of the toolkit seems to have complemented the students' initial keen interest in technology itself, with awareness about urgent issues related to the climate and the environment.","Costa, Daniele Screpanti, Laura Scaradozzi, David",161,"Costa, D Screpanti, L Scaradozzi, D",,"[Costa, Daniele] Univ Politecn Marche, DIISM Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.

"As the student population in the United States (US) is becoming more diverse, educator preparation programs are seeking ways to make the teacher workforce more diverse, which involves diversification of training experiences. Informal spaces, which can include integrated science, mathematics, engineering and technology (STEM) opportunities, are not traditionally part of teacher preparation, although teachers are being asked to occupy these STEM spaces with more frequency. Including informal experiences in a community STEM makerspace, which highlights digital fabrication, creativity, and problem solving, diversifies teacher preparation by extending beyond both the university setting and the elementary classroom. This exploratory case study with elementary (primary) pre-service teachers in a science and math methods (vis a vis STEM) class examines experiences they have in a community makerspace in a qualitative study, which uses Data Engagement (DE) as a methodological framework. DE draws upon intersectional feminist, critical, and materialist theories. Assembled and made data from observations in the makerspace, pre- and post-maker reflections, and responses to a modified in-person interview protocol reveal that, despite more open-ended and complex challenges than those experienced in class, participants reported positive future-thinking, less content dread, and more agency in perceived efficacy. These results invite further study and conversation about including informal STEM maker experiences in US teacher preparation as a step to increasing diversity in the teacher workforce.","Douglass, Helen",538,"Douglass, H",,"[Douglass, Helen] Univ Tulsa, Dept Educ, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.",University of Tulsa,,,,,2025-01-19,informal STEM education; community makerspaces; elementary teacher preparation,10.3390/educsci13060538,Article,,2227-7102,hed2054@utulsa.edu,,,,,K1PC8,SCIENCE; SCHOOL; PERCEPTIONS; IDENTITY; GENDER; POLICY,6,EDUC SCI,Educ.

"Civil engineers play a pivotal role in addressing key societal and global issues. Accordingly, civil engineering educators are tasked with equipping their students with multi-disciplinary skill-sets that empower them to evaluate and solve critical challenges - which include sustainability, safety, transportation, housing, and other infrastructure needs. To accomplish these educational goals, much research has focused on designing, delivering, and testing educational interventions that immerse civil engineering students into relevant learning experiences. The knowledge gained from these research efforts is largely dispersed and fragmented - which is currently a barrier to the development of a robust and proven civil engineering curriculum. The current research summarizes some of the educational interventions that have been developed and tested with students pursuing a civil engineering career to answer questions such as: what problem areas does the developed interventions seek to tackle, what are the characteristics and elements of the interventions, what problem areas have the educational interventions not addressed? The primary objectives of the article were accomplished through a comprehensive review of literature across areas including construction engineering, environmental engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, geotechnical engineering, and others. Apart from examining the gaps in the broader literature, the article will serve as a concise resource that can help engineering educators and university administrators develop a robust learning experience for their civil engineering students.","Albert, Lynal",,"Albert, L",663,"[Albert, Lynal] Tarleton State Univ, Dept Engn & Comp Sci, Stephenville, TX 76402 USA.",Texas A&M University System; Tarleton State University,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; engineering education; interventions in engineering education,,Review,,,albert@tarleton.edu,671,,,,RO4QX,TRANSPORTATION EDUCATION; STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS; SUSTAINABILITY; REALITY; DESIGN; MULTIMEDIA; SYSTEM; TOOLS; MODEL,3,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the integration of various Emerging Technologies in the field of Education, especially immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). This research aims at assessing the perceived usefulness of these technologies by pre-service teachers at the Faculty of Educational Sciences of the University of Granada, specifically in the STEM field, and how they evaluate their potential for integration into their future teaching practices. A mixed-methods approach was used, including a pre-questionnaire administered to the entire population (N=544) to describe the participants' perceptions, followed by a post-test conducted with a subset (N=58) after having participated in a Complementary Training program focusing on the creation of immersive educational resources using the CoSpaces platform. The results revealed a high perceived utility of immersive technologies, highlighting their potential for enhancing teaching and learning in the STEM domain. However, challenges related to ease of integration and the lack of adequate training in the use of these technologies were identified. The importance of promoting teacher training and digital literacy to fully leverage the benefits of these emerging technologies in education is emphasized. Further research is suggested to delve into teacher training strategies and explore other educational contexts to expand the understanding of the implications and advantages of immersive technologies.","Diaz, Franciscosilva Rosua, Javier Carrillo Ferrer, Gracia Fernandez Carmona, Rafael Marfil Narvaez, Romina",,"Díaz, F Rosúa, JC Ferrer, GF Carmona, RM Narváez, R",,"[Diaz, Franciscosilva; Rosua, Javier Carrillo; Ferrer, Gracia Fernandez; Carmona, Rafael Marfil; Narvaez, Romina] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain.

One approach to helping teachers gain a sense of comfort with current science practices, including the process of argumentation, known as Argument-based Strategies for STEM Infused Science Teaching (ASSIST), has recently been designed as a means of providing professional development opportunities for K-12 science teachers. As part of the ASSIST program, participating teachers provided written feedback in the form of self-reflections that focus on the challenges they have faced when attempting to implement the ASSIST approach with their students. These self-reflections were examined using the tools of critical discourse analysis (CDA) to uncover themes in the language used by participants as they express difficulties in implementing a new approach to science teaching. Our analysis reveals struggles for power at the instructional, institutional, and interpersonal levels that can stand in the way of progressive approaches to teaching and learning. Fundamental to the power struggles reported on in this research are competing educational ideologies that can be discovered and explored using CDA. Implications for the planning and design of science teacher professional development programs will be discussed.","Anderson Quarderer, Nathan McDermott, Mark A.",,"Quarderer, NA McDermott, MA",2483,"[Anderson Quarderer, Nathan; McDermott, Mark A.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",University of Iowa,,,,,2025-01-19,Argument-based inquiry; Argumentation; Professional development; Science writing heuristic; Critical discourse analysis,10.1007/s11165-018-9790-z,Article,,1573-1898,nathan-quarderer@uiowa.edu; mark-a-mcdermott@uiowa.edu,2504,,,,OR0VH,STEM EDUCATION; LITERACY; STUDENTS; BELIEFS; SENSE,6,RES SCI EDUC,Res.

"The National Science Foundation (NSF) has a long history of investment in broadening participation (BP) in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. A review of past NSF BP efforts provides insights into how the portfolio of programs and activities has evolved and the broad array of innovative strategies that has been used to increase the participation of groups underrepresented in STEM, including women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. While many are familiar with these long-standing programmatic efforts, BP is also a key component of NSF's strategic plans, has been highlighted in National Science Board reports, and is the focus of ongoing outreach efforts. The majority of familiar BP programs, such as the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (now 25 years old), are housed in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources. However, fellowship programs such as the Graduate Research Fellowships and Postdoctoral Research Fellowships under the Directorate for Biological Sciences (and parallel directorates in other STEM disciplines) are frequently used to address underrepresentation in STEM disciplines. The FY2016 and FY2017 budget requests incorporate funding for NSF INCLUDES, a new cross-agency BP initiative that will build on prior successes while addressing national BP challenges. NSF INCLUDES invites the use of innovative approaches for taking evidence-based best practices to scale, ushering in a new era in NSF BP advancement.","James, Sylvia M.

"A promising approach to increase students' motivation for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is integrated STEM education (iSTEM). This is an instructional approach that emphasizes the deeper connections between the STEM disciplines by involving students in design challenges centered around real-world problems. However, the successful implementation of a new instructional approach, such as iSTEM, strongly depends on teachers' attitudes toward the innovation. Therefore, a deeper understanding of teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM is necessary. This study uses a survey method to investigate the influence of teachers' background characteristics and school context variables on teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM. To do so, a differential approach is used. Attitudes toward five key principles for iSTEM (integration, problem-centered, inquiry-based, design-based, and cooperative learning) are examined separately to get a more in-depth and nuanced insight into the factors influencing these attitudes. Results of the multiple regression analyses show that participation in professional development is positively linked to teachers' attitudes toward all key principles, whereas several other teacher and school context variables are positively correlated with attitudes toward one or two principles. Moreover, experience in mathematics and total years of teaching show a negative correlation with several aspects of teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM. Findings of this study are valuable, since they not only provide insight into possible barriers to the implementation of iSTEM but also suggest opportunities for overcoming these barriers.","Thibaut, Lieve Knipprath, Heidi Dehaene, Wim Depaepe, Fien",,"Thibaut, L Knipprath, H Dehaene, W Depaepe, F",987,"[Thibaut, Lieve; Knipprath, Heidi] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Inst Work & Soc HIVA, Res Grp Educ & Labour Market, Parkstr 47 Box 5300, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.

"Science and mathematics are becoming computational endeavors. This fact is reflected in the recently released Next Generation Science Standards and the decision to include ""computational thinking"" as a core scientific practice. With this addition, and the increased presence of computation in mathematics and scientific contexts, a new urgency has come to the challenge of defining computational thinking and providing a theoretical grounding for what form it should take in school science and mathematics classrooms. This paper presents a response to this challenge by proposing a definition of computational thinking for mathematics and science in the form of a taxonomy consisting of four main categories: data practices, modeling and simulation practices, computational problem solving practices, and systems thinking practices. In formulating this taxonomy, we draw on the existing computational thinking literature, interviews with mathematicians and scientists, and exemplary computational thinking instructional materials. This work was undertaken as part of a larger effort to infuse computational thinking into high school science and mathematics curricular materials. In this paper, we argue for the approach of embedding computational thinking in mathematics and science contexts, present the taxonomy, and discuss how we envision the taxonomy being used to bring current educational efforts in line with the increasingly computational nature of modern science and mathematics.","Weintrop, David Beheshti, Elham Horn, Michael Orton, Kai Jona, Kemi Trouille, Laura Wilensky, Uri",,"Weintrop, D Beheshti, E Horn, M Orton, K Jona, K Trouille, L Wilensky, U",127,"[Weintrop, David; Horn, Michael; Orton, Kai; Wilensky, Uri] Northwestern Univ, Ctr Connected Learning & Comp Based Modeling, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.

"Emphasizing stoichiometry appears to be a norm of introductory chemistry courses. In this longitudinal and mixed-methods study, we examined how the emphasis on stoichiometry in assessments of introductory chemistry impacted educational equity and student learning. Using quantitative methods, we identified mole and stoichiometric conversions as two of the most frequently assessed and inequitable competencies, perpetuating systemic inequities in access to pre-college mathematics preparation. Above all other competencies, midterm assessments of stoichiometry were the most impactful as the strongest predictor of students' scores on both the first and second-semester introductory chemistry final exam. These results informed the development of a think-aloud protocol used to describe how students approached assessments of stoichiometry. Students described stoichiometry as a step-by-step series of calculations, rarely associating this algorithm with the process of a chemical reaction by which reactants break bonds and rearrange to form products. Student responses suggest stoichiometry substitutes learning how to apply chemistry to think about the problems scientists solve for memorizing algorithms to solve math problems in the context of chemistry. Shifting the foundation of introductory chemistry courses from algorithmic to applied competencies reflects scientific practice and maybe one strategy for educators to disrupt systemic barriers to access and retention in STEM Education. Based on these findings and the advancements of other research, we offer implications for supporting educators as they iteratively develop increasingly relevant and equitable assessments of introductory chemistry.","Ralph, Vanessa Rosa States, Nicole E.

"Purpose - This paper aims to describe the design and user testing of GeoForge, a multiple-player digital learning experience for middle school that leverages virtual reality (VR) and individualized websites for learning concepts in planetary science. This paper investigates how specific instructional design choices and features of the technology fostered collaborative behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - GeoForge was implemented in 3 middle school classrooms with a total of 220 students. Learners used GeoForge in class in groups of 3-4 to learn about planetary science. A mixed-methods approach examined collaboration using classroom observations, teacher interviews, student surveys and student artifacts. Using Jeong and Hmelo-Silver's (2016) seven affordances of technology for collaborative learning, this paper identifies ways in which features of GeoForge supported collaborative behaviors. Findings - Instructional design which combined VR and the digital science journal (DSJ) helped foster collaboration. Some collaborative behaviors were especially notable in classrooms that did not regularly practice these skills. Segmenting tasks in the DSJ, clarifying instructions to articulate ideas, showing other group members' responses onscreen and enabling multiuser VR environments contributed to collaborative behaviors and a satisfying learning experience as observed and documented through multiple methods. Originality/value - GeoForge successfully integrated VR and personalized websites in a classroom planetary science lesson, an approach which balanced instructional design and logistical challenges while creating opportunities for collaboration.","Brenner, Corinne DesPortes, Kayla Ochoa Hendrix, Jessica Holford, Mande",,"Brenner, C DesPortes, K Hendrix, JO Holford, M",546,"[Brenner, Corinne; Ochoa Hendrix, Jessica] Killer Snails, Brooklyn, NY 11226 USA.

"The end of hard coal mining in Germany and other European countries has been leading to new challenges in post-mining and utilisation of abandoned mines while opening up new perspectives concerning the remains of former min -ing as well as new fields of work for specialised personnel at the same time. Coping with the resulting perpetual tasks places new demands on already trained experts and offers the opportunity to familiarise the next generation of students with post-mining issues and solution approaches from the beginning. This article presents two closely interrelated projects - the USAMIN Project and the PepperMINT Project - which aim to successfully recruit and train future professionals. For this purpose, the USAMIN (USe of Abandoned MINes) Project creates a new form of distance learning as multilateral coopera-tion, which strengthens the training of specialised experts and the scientific exchange across European borders. Furthermore, the main goal of this project is the establishment of networks between scientists and other experts, thus strengthening inter-national cooperation. The PepperMINT Project's STEM online courses aim to motivate high school students to pursue STEM studies by introducing them to the field of engineering, while simultaneously strengthening students, especially in their first semesters. By linking the two projects, various actors can be connected according to their education and a large part of the education chain can be viewed in a holistic approach.","Dogan, Tansel Michael, Lisa Rudolph, Tobias Moellerherm, Stefan Paschedag, Ulrich",,"Dogan, T Michael, L Rudolph, T Möllerherm, S Paschedag, U",697,"[Dogan, Tansel; Michael, Lisa; Rudolph, Tobias; Moellerherm, Stefan; Paschedag, Ulrich] TH Georg Agr, Forschungszentrum Nachbergbau, Herner Str 45, D-44787 Bochum, Germany.",,,,,,2025-01-19,USAMIN; PepperMINT; post-mining; E-learning; STEM education,10.1127/zdgg/2022/0342,Article,NOV 2022,1861-4094,tansel.dogan@thga.de; lisa.michael@thga.de; tobias.rudolph@thga.de; stefan.moellerherm@thga.de; ulrich.paschedag@thga.de,706,,,,G5SY8,,4,Z DTSCH GES GEOWISS,Z.

"Sensor systems have the potential to make abstract science phenomena concrete for K-12 students. Internet of Things (IoT) sensor systems provide a variety of benefits for modern classrooms, creating the opportunity for global data production, orienting learners to the opportunities and drawbacks of distributed sensor and control systems, and reducing classroom hardware burden by allowing many students to ""listen"" to the same data stream. To date, few robust IoT classroom systems have emerged, partially due to lack of appropriate curriculum and student-accessible interfaces, and partially due to lack of classroom-compliant server technology. In this article, we present an architecture and sensor kit system that addresses issues of sensor ubiquity, acquisition clarity, data transparency, reliability, and security. The system has a dataflow programming interface to support both science practices and computational data practices, exposing the movement of data through programs and data files. The IoT Dataflow System supports authentic uses of computational tools for data production through this distributed cloud-based system, overcoming a variety of implementation challenges specific to making programs run for arbitrary duration on a variety of sensors. In practice, this system provides a number of unique yet unexplored educational opportunities. Early results show promise for Dataflow as a valuable learning technology from research conducted in a high school classroom.","Bondaryk, Leslie G.

"STEM education is crucial in the digital intelligence era, imposing new demands and challenges on teachers. However, there is limited focus on the job stress and innovative work behaviour of STEM teachers, particularly on how job stressors influence their innovative behaviour. This study, from the perspective of school organisational administrators, based on the JDCS Model and social learning theory, surveyed 849 primary and secondary school STEM teachers across 11 provinces in China using scales for Job Stress, Creative Self-Efficacy, Creative Motivation, and Teachers' Innovative Work Behaviour. Results indicated that job demand positively influences innovative work behaviour directly and indirectly through creative motivation and the serial mediation of creative self-efficacy and creative motivation, contributing 38.4%. Job control also positively influences innovative work behaviour indirectly via creative self-efficacy and the serial mediation of creative self-efficacy and creative motivation, contributing 32.2%. Similarly, job support impacts innovative work behaviour indirectly through creative self-efficacy and its serial mediation with creative motivation, contributing 21.9%. Collectively, job demand, control, and support affect STEM teachers' job stress. It is recommended that school administrators balance job demand and support, adjust job control, and provide targeted support to enhance teachers' creative self-efficacy and motivation, fostering innovative work behaviour.","Wu, Bin Song, Ye Zuo, Mingzhang Zhai, Li Zhang, Mengsi",,"Wu, B Song, Y Zuo, MZ Zhai, L Zhang, MS",,"[Wu, Bin; Song, Ye; Zhai, Li; Zhang, Mengsi] Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Xinyang, Peoples R China.

"Over the past quarter century, my engagement with the protein society has allowed me to witness first-hand the evolution of our deepening understanding of the complexity of protein folding landscapes. During my own evolution as a protein scientist, my passion for protein folding has deepened into an obsession with mapping and decoding the thermodynamic and kinetic secrets of protein landscapes-especially those of rebel proteins, whose ""nontraditional"" behavior has challenged our paradigms and inspired the expansion of our models and methods. It is perhaps not surprising that I see parallels in the evolution of the landscape framework and in the development of our own trajectories as humans in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Just as with proteins, however, we need to recognize that our individual human landscapes are not isolated from our local departmental and institutional communities, and are integrated into the larger networks of our STEM disciplines, academia, industry, and/or government, not to mention society. My experience with hundreds of participants in the Being Human in STEM (HSTEM) initiative that Amherst College undergraduates and I co-founded in 2016 has helped me find hope for STEM and humanity. If we commit to reconciling our identities as scientists with our responsibilities as human beings, together we can accelerate the evolution of individual, community, and societal landscapes to contribute to addressing the dire challenges facing our planet.","Jaswal, Sheila S.",,"Jaswal, SS",768,"[Jaswal, Sheila S.] Amherst Coll, Dept Chem, 25 East Dr, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.

"Informal STEM education programs through youth-serving organizations like 4-H have the potential to help youth prepare for future STEM careers. Volunteers continue to be an important way to mentor and provide programs for youth with support and guidance from professionals working for youth organizations. 4-H STEM programs present challenges for 4-H professionals and traditional 4-H volunteers who often have limited knowledge and confidence in their ability to teach STEM skills. Recruiting science experts as volunteers to lead 4-H STEM programs is one way to provide these programs, but some experts have limited knowledge about youth development and how to engage youth. Findings from the 4-H Science: Building a 4-H Career Pathway initiative are discussed here related to volunteer training, volunteer recruitment and retention and resources needed for 4-H professionals and volunteers to successfully implement 4-H STEM programs. A process evaluation was conducted that included focus groups and interviews in 3 states that participated in the initiative. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with youth, parents, volunteers, and 4-H professionals involved in 4-H STEM programs. Themes included the need for volunteer training focused on increasing STEM knowledge and skills as well as pedagogy and youth engagement, the need for training for 4-H professionals related to STEM skills so they could support volunteer efforts, and the need to use diverse methods to recruit science experts and other volunteers for these programs.","Franck, Karen L.

"Amid the maker movement, educators are proposing various making activities with programmable artifacts to prepare students for coping with the challenges in the twenty-first century. Today, the ""4C"" skills-critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration-are regarded as significant learning outcomes in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education; however, few researchers have investigated the adoption of problem-based learning in K-12 programming education for developing students' 4C skills. A case study was conducted in a ""digital making"" camp in which 54 upper elementary and lower secondary school students (10-14 years old) were engaged in harnessing a block-based programming tool, Scratch, to conduct various problem-solving tasks. Through triangulating multiple sources of qualitative data (including lesson plans, classroom field notes, videotaped lesson records, student solutions/artifacts, and post-intervention interviews), together with the microgenetic learning analysis, this study characterizes students' 4C skills development in the process of problem-based digital making. We found that the problem-based digital making environment supported the students' development of (a) critical thinking in the form of critical modeling and critical data handling; (b) creativity in the form of creative explorations, creative solutions, and creative expressions; and (c) communication and collaboration in the form of communicative scaffolding and collaborative debugging. Complementary evidence-based suggestions for scaffolding problem-based digital making activities are suggested.","Weng, Xiaojing Cui, Zhihao Ng, Oi-Lam Jong, Morris S. Y. Chiu, Thomas K.

"The socio-economic impacts of unforeseen health challenges among mine workers cannot be overemphasized. Due to the nature of artisanal mining in Ghana, workers are responsible for their own health care. This, however, necessitates the need for insight into the dynamics of self-care among artisanal miners. A cross-sectional survey of 500 artisanal gold miners was conducted to explore the relationship between working conditions of artisanal miners and voluntarily going for routine medical checkup, even in the absence of the right support systems, using a nested binary logistic regression. All the working condition variables were robust in predicting routine medical checkup in all three models. In this case, goldminers who reported good health, safety and environmental conditions were more likely to go for routine medical checkup as compared to their co-workers who reported poor health, safety and environmental conditions. Contrariwise, miners who reported good economic conditions were less likely to go for routine medical checkup as compared to their counterparts who reported poor economic conditions. Also, routine medical checkup was less likely among artisanal miners who did not protect themselves at work and had experienced work related health challenges. For the compositional factors, miners who had senior high school education were more likely to go for routine medical checkup as compared to those with no formal education. Likewise, older miners were more probable to go for routine medical checkup as compared to their younger counterparts. At the contextual level, miners who worked on shift regime and miners who worked in non-production departments were more likely to go for routine medical checkup. The outcome of this study provides insight into the dynamics of self-care amongst artisanal miners and how best to possibly improve it in an attempt to maintain a healthy workforce and its cascading effects. To increase consciousness of self-health care in artisanal mining, there is the need for a national dialogue on how to improve the working conditions of artisanal miners in Ghana.","Aram, Simon Appah",e07596,"Aram, SA",,"[Aram, Simon Appah] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Environm Sci, Cape Coast, Ghana.

"Background: The prevalence of obesity among preschool-aged children has increased, especially among those in low-income households. Two promising behavioral targets for preventing obesity include limiting children's portion sizes and their intake of foods high in solid fats and/or added sugars, but these approaches have not been studied in low-income preschoolers in the home setting. The purpose of this study was to understand the contextual factors that might influence how low-income mothers felt about addressing these behavioral targets and mothers' aspirations in feeding their children. Methods: We recruited 32 English-speaking women in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who were eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and who were the biologic mothers of children 36 to 66 months of age. Each mother participated in 1 of 7 focus groups and completed a brief socio-demographic questionnaire. Focus group questions centered on eating occasions, foods and drinks consumed in the home, and portion sizes. Each focus group lasted 90 minutes and was digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Three authors independently identified key themes and supporting quotations. Themes were condensed and modified through discussion among all authors. Results: Thirty-one mothers identified themselves as black, 15 had a high school education or less, and 22 lived with another adult. Six themes emerged, with three about aspirations mothers held in feeding their children and three about challenges to achieving these aspirations. Mothers' aspirations were to: 1) prevent hyperactivity and tooth decay by limiting children's sugar intake, 2) use feeding to teach their children life lessons about limit setting and structure, and 3) be responsive to children during mealtimes to guide decisions about portions. Especially around setting limits with sweets and snacks, mothers faced the challenges of: 1) being nagged by children's food requests, 2) being undermined by other adults in the family, and 3) having bad memories from childhood that made it hard to deny children's food requests. Conclusions: Although the primary aspirations of low-income mothers in feeding their preschool-aged children were not focused on children's weight, these aspirations were compatible with obesity prevention strategies to limit children's portion sizes and their intake of solid fats and/or added sugars.","Herman, Allison N.

"Citizen science is gaining popularity as a way to engage people to participate in environmental projects. In addition to potential challenges regarding data quality and the choice of variables, a key factor in the success of participatory monitoring projects is the active participation of volunteers, the ""citizen scientists."" To learn more about the motivation of citizen scientists to participate and their socio-economic background, a telephone survey was implemented with participants of a citizen science water level monitoring program in the Sondu-Miriu basin, western Kenya. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and random forest models to elucidate the characteristics of the participant population, underlying motivations, and the challenges and opportunities to develop recommendations for sustainable community-based water monitoring programs. As citizen scientists who engaged long-term were 30-49 years old, had primary or secondary school education and passed by the monitoring station frequently, targeting sensitization activities at people with such background could increase participation in community-based water monitoring. Sensitization meetings were key in engaging long-term volunteers, but participants indicated that continued feedback through education and communication of the project findings is required to keep volunteers motivated. The use of cellphone credit to submit data was identified as challenge for participation, highlighting the need for data submission methods that do not incur costs for the participants. Greater volunteer support could also be achieved by active involvement of the members of Water Resource Users Associations, since membership increased the likelihood of continuous engagement in water monitoring under the participants. Furthermore, many participants indicated that their motivation was to help water management and conservation, as most people rely directly on rivers for their water supply. Providing a platform to contribute to better water resources management could therefore result in direct benefits (e.g., improved water supply) for the participants, and thus an incentive to participate actively.","Weeser, Bjorn Graf, Jan Njue, Naomi K.

"BackgroundParents of very young children recently diagnosed with developmental disabilities (DD) need to identify environmental barriers to their children's participation and adopt an adaptive orientation to solving these problems. Given the health service disparities for diverse families, parents may benefit from easy to use problem-identification approaches that address environmental barriers stemming from community and policy contexts. This feasibility study evaluated the usability of a health literacy-informed, structured, environment-focused problem-identification approach for parents of young children with DD. MethodsWe used purposeful, convenience sampling to enrol 9 mothers of children ages 1-3 with DD (4 racial/ethnic minorities, 3 high school education, 4 annual household income <$20,000). We developed a structured problem-identification approach guided by a social ecological model featuring home, community, and policy contexts. The approach was applied to 3 short stories during a narrative elicitation interview. Two researchers independently coded parent responses for the type of barrier and solution identified with and without the approach. ResultsParents identified 121 environmental barriers without the approach. When using the approach and prompted to consider home, community, and policy barriers, parents identified an additional 222 environmental barriers; the greatest number of barriers were aligned with International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health-Children and Youth environment Chapter 5 Services, systems, and policies. Using the approach, parents with a postgraduate education and annual household income >$80,000 identified the most environmental barriers, and parents reporting the lowest annual household incomes identified the fewest environmental barriers. When parents attributed participation challenges to an environmental barrier, similar to 57% of solutions required parents to interact with individuals at the community or policy level. ConclusionsThis study suggests that parents with a range of background characteristics can use a structured, environment-focused problem-identification approach. With the approach, parents are more likely to attribute participation challenges to environmental barriers and adopt a problem-solving orientation focused on changes to the community and policy context.","Kramer, J.

"In this study, fish farmers' management practices, occurrence, and knowledge of fish diseases in Nyeri County, Kenya, were evaluated. Fish farming management practices for small-scale farmers in Kenya have numerous challenges which have led to disease occurrence and reduced production. Moreover, the impact and association of these challenges to farmers' knowledge of fish diseases and their burden has not been fully studied. A semistructured questionnaire was used to capture farmers' biodata, fish species farmed, and farmers' management practices such as handling of nets, pond fertilization, and disposal of fish waste. Farmers' knowledge of fish diseases was based on their ability to identify independent and dependent variable indicators. Independent variables included clinical signs, decreased feeding, bulging eyes, floating on water, abdominal swelling, bulging eyes, abnormal skin color, reduced growth, and abnormal swimming with fish death as were the dependent variable. A total of 208 farmers were interviewed and included those of tilapia (134), mixed tilapia and catfish (40), catfish (22), rainbow trout, and five dams under cooperative management. Tilapia was the most kept fish species (66.8%) followed by polyculture of tilapia and catfish (20%) and rainbow trout (2%). Most respondents were male (78.5%) over 51 years of age (50%). Fifty percent of the respondents had secondary school education. There was a significant association between deaths and sharing of nets in Kieni East subcounty (p=0.0049, chi-square), while on-farm fish waste disposing appeared to cause higher deaths compared to burning of the waste although not statistically significant (p=0.13). Few respondents observed decreased feed uptake (<20%) and poor growth. Fifty-seven percent of farmers reported mortalities. Fish poor growth, floating in water, and management practices in subcounties had significant effect on fish deaths. The farmers had knowledge of signs of diseased fish, but there was paucity of knowing the specific causes of disease. Farmers need to be empowered on best aquaculture husbandry to avoid disease transmission and specific fish disease signs to enhance proper reporting of disease for subsequent mitigation measures.","Mulei, Isaac R.

"Objectives A growing body of literature documents a positive association between adult children's education and older parents' health, and existing studies have identified social support, social influence, and material transfers as factors linking adult children's education and various dimensions of older parents' health. The present study joins this literature by assessing adult children's problems as mechanisms that may underlie disparities in psychological well-being between mothers whose adult children have completed higher and lower levels of education. Methods Using 2 waves of longitudinal data collected in 2001-2003 and 2008-2011 from 400 mothers aged 73-85 years at the second wave as part of the Within-Family Differences Study, we examine the role of adult children's problems in mediating the association between adult children's education and mothers' depressive symptoms. Results Mothers with children who completed post-high school education reported fewer depressive symptoms than mothers whose children all completed high school or less. We found evidence that this relationship was mediated by the proportion of adult children who have experienced physical and emotional problems in the last 5 years. Discussion This study underscores the importance of considering how resources and risks that affect well-being accumulate both across the life course and across generations.

"Students who complete their high school education are, at times, not adequately prepared for further studies in higher education. Some of these students struggle to meet the challenges associated with heavy workloads, extra laboratory work and a blended-learning environment. These underprepared students need additional academic support if they are to succeed with their university studies. One such support includes an additional year of study (part of an Extended Curriculum Programme aimed at improving student preparedness) prior to enrolling in a mainstream programme where they may study towards a Diploma or Bachelor's degree. The purpose of this article is to contrast the performance of these students to those who directly entered a mainstream programme, thereby highlighting the benefit of an additional year of study in helping students to become better prepared. This contrast is primarily based on their main examination grades that they achieved in a first-year compulsory module that forms part of a National Diploma in Electrical Engineering. Sixty-four students, with an additional year of study, are contrasted to 487 students who entered a mainstream programme directly between 2016 and 2017. Both groups of students struggled with questions relating to design which is correlated to the synthesis level in Bloom's Taxonomy. However, the average grade difference between the two groups never exceeded 10%, with the average being 6.9%. The contribution to education is the positive results achieved by these first-year students who enrolled for an extended curriculum programme, thereby supporting its continuance.","Swart, Arthur James Delport, Danri",,"Swart, AJ Delport, D",1151,"[Swart, Arthur James; Delport, Danri] Cent Univ Technol, Fac Engn Built Environm & Informat Technol, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",Central University of Technology,,,,,2025-01-19,university of technology; Extended Curriculum Programme; Mainstream Programme; first-years,,Article,,,drjamesswart@gmail.com,1158,,,,6R5TY,,4,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

"Objective. The construct of Health Literacy (HL) deals with patients' capacity to understand their health-related instructions, consent forms, and other documents. A significant challenge of providing healthcare to patients with low HL is the complex nature of the disease process, and of requisite treatments. In radiation oncology specifically, the delivery of ionizing radiation is difficult enough to describe; describing radiation toxicity in terms of the underlying physics and biology is daunting. A multimodal analysis of a small sample of patient consent forms was undertaken in order to address this issue more closely, and identify the extent to which such literature contributes to the challenges faced by patients with low HL Methods. Members of national cooperative group panels dealing with gynecologic cancer were asked to submit copies of consent forms provided to patients with stage II cervical cancer. Four such forms were submitted and reviewed by a single person with expertise in linguistics using standard tools. Results. Three of the four consents scored within the lower portion of the ""adequate"" range. One consent was not suitable. Consent readability ranged from grades 12.18 to 16.13; this means that they required at least a high school education to interpret, and in two cases required post-graduate coursework. Conclusion. There is significant room for improvement in consent form design and structure. When considering cultural and socioeconomic appropriateness of patient consent forms, input of staff with expertise in linguistics should be sought. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"The authors describe their findings from a study that (1) identified 41 medical schools or medical school departments that used metric systems to quantify faculty activity and productivity in teaching and (2) analyzed the purposes and progress of those systems. Among the reasons articulated for developing these systems, the most common was to identify a ""rational"" method for distributing funds to departments. More generally, institutions wanted to emphasize the importance of the school's educational mission. The schools varied in the types of information they tracked, ranging from a selective focus on medical school education to a comprehensive assessment of teaching activity and educational administration, committee work, and advising. Schools were almost evenly split between those that used a relative,value-unit method of tracking activity and those that used a contact,hour method. This study also identified six challenges that the institutions encountered with these metric systems: (1) the lack of a culture of data in management; (2) skepticism of faculty and chairs; (3) the misguided search for one perfect metric; (4) the expectation that a metric system will erase ambiguity regarding faculty teaching contributions; (5) the lack of, and difficulty with developing, measures of quality; and (6) the tendency to become overly complex. Because of the concern about the teaching mission at medical schools, the number of institutions developing educational metric systems will likely increase in the coming years. By documenting and accounting financially for teaching, medical schools can ensure that the educational mission is valued and appropriately supported.","Mallon, WT Jones, RF",,"Mallon, WT Jones, RF",115,"Assoc Amer Med Coll, Div Inst & Fac Studies, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",Association of American Medical Colleges,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1097/00001888-200202000-00005,Article,,1938-808X,wmallon@aamc.org,123,,,,523JA,RELATIVE-VALUE,2,ACAD MED,Acad.

"Global challenges and recent changes in conflict areas in the Middle East, Asia and Africa are reasons for the contemporary forced migration into European countries, which have become places of destination or transit posts for a great number of refugees. Cities have become the focus of the socio-spatial debate, as the main units for receiving refugees, either in state camps or in social housing in city centres. In this article, the focus is on the social-spatial configuration of refugee accommodation in local communities and the way these formations generate urban and school segregation. We argue that the placement of urban refugees in large, camp-like structures with low housing standards, mainly in areas outside cities or in rural areas, provides ground not only for social exclusion and 'territorial stigmatisation' but also for de facto school segregation. Furthermore, the attempts to house refugees in small cities, through United Nations and NGO-supplied houses, may also raise concerns about the way dispersal policies are implemented, with the distribution of refugee children in specific schools as a result of territorial social-spatial segregation. In both cases, the school segregation of refugees is connected not only with the implications of immigration and education policies but also with the social practices of local communities and the social-spatial characteristics that determine school education. The empirical material of this study is based on information on the socio-economic profiles of neighbourhoods at the census tract level and on qualitative research, through in-depth semi-structured interviews in two different cities in Greece.","Vergou, Pinelopi",0042098019846448,"Vergou, P",3162,"[Vergou, Pinelopi] Univ Thessaly, Volos, Greece.",University of Thessaly,,,,,2025-01-19,educational inequalities; refugees; residential segregation; school segregation,10.1177/0042098019846448,Article,JUL 2019,1360-063X,pvergou@uth.gr,3177,,,,JD8OJ,ASYLUM; CENTERS,15,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,English,,37,,"Vergou, Pinelopi/0000-0003-1313-4924","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",NOV,16,LONDON,,,J,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,2019,,"Vergou, P (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, October 28th Str 78, Volos 38221, Greece.",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,SI,0042-0980,URBAN STUDIES,,,12,Living with difference: Refugee education and school segregation processes in Greece,0,21,WOS:000478530600001,56,,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),12
"Education is a universal right for every citizen, regardless of ethnicity and social class. Quilombola school education has faced numerous challenges over the years, as this problem is a vestige of the historical denial of education for the black population. This stems from a socio-spatial configuration of how Brazilian society was formed. The present work aims to emphasize the importance of quilombola education in the countryside, having as a spatial cut the community of remnant quilombola Muquem in the state of Alagoas, emphasizing the quilombola school curriculum developed through law 10.639 / 2003. The participating research involved students from the 6th, 7th, and 9th grade of Muquem School, principals, and community residents. The work is based on documentary study, field research addressing the qualitative character having as theoretical basis Paulo Feire (1987) with his contribution on the theme of education in the field for the formation of citizenship. For better deepening, it was necessary to collect data questionnaires application for students and interviews with residents and school management of the community about the presence of the school in the locality. The results show that through the national law that aims to study the teaching of Brazilian black culture and African roots is with many efforts and dedication that the community has been working pedagogical projects that enable a new construction of the history of the black people. After the 2010 flood, over the last 7 years, it has developed a pedagogical curriculum that aims at moral principles such as mutual respect, citizenship and diversity.","Paulino da Silva, Thais Patricia Barbosa, Marily Oliveira",,"da Silva, TPP Barbosa, MO",156,"[Paulino da Silva, Thais Patricia] Grp Estudos Terr GETERRI, Arapiraca, AL, Brazil.

"The aim of this paper is to review conceptual and empirical literature on the concept of distributed leadership (DL) in order to identify its origins, key arguments and areas for further work. Consideration is given to the similarities and differences between DL and related concepts, including 'shared', 'collective', 'collaborative', 'emergent', 'co-' and 'democratic' leadership. Findings indicate that, while there are some common theoretical bases, the relative usage of these concepts varies over time, between countries and between sectors. In particular, DL is a notion that has seen a rapid growth in interest since the year 2000, but research remains largely restricted to the field of school education and of proportionally more interest to UK than US-based academics. Several scholars are increasingly going to great lengths to indicate that, in order to be 'distributed', leadership need not necessarily be widely 'shared' or 'democratic' and, in order to be effective, there is a need to balance different 'hybrid configurations' of practice. The paper highlights a number of areas for further attention, including three factors relating to the context of much work on DL (power and influence; organizational boundaries and context; and ethics and diversity), and three methodological and developmental challenges (ontology; research methods; and leadership development, reward and recognition). It is concluded that descriptive and normative perspectives which dominate the literature should be supplemented by more critical accounts which recognize the rhetorical and discursive significance of DL in (re) constructing leader-follower identities, mobilizing collective engagement and challenging or reinforcing traditional forms of organization.","Bolden, Richard",,"Bolden, R",251,"Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Ctr Leadership Studies, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England.",University of Exeter,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1111/j.1468-2370.2011.00306.x,Article,,1468-2370,Richard.Bolden@exeter.ac.uk,269,,,,807OY,HIGHER-EDUCATION; COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP; COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP; SHARED LEADERSHIP; POWER; TEAM; MODERNIZATION; PERSPECTIVES; SUBSTITUTES; PERCEPTIONS,3,INT J MANAG REV,Int.

"Objectives This study computes years and proportion of life that older adults living in the United States can expect to live pain-free and in different pain states, by age, sex, and level of education. The analysis addresses challenges related to dynamics and mortality selection when studying associations between education and pain in older populations. Methods Data are from National Health and Aging Trends Study, 2011-2020. The sample contains 10,180 respondents who are age 65 and older. Pain expectancy estimates are computed using the Interpolated Markov Chain software that applies probability transitions to multistate life tables. Results Those with higher educational levels expect not only a longer life but also a higher proportion of life without pain. For example, a 65-year-old female with less than high school education expects 18.1 years in total and 5.8 years, or 32% of life, without pain compared with 23.7 years in total with 10.7 years, or 45% of life without pain if she completed college. The education gradient in pain expectancies is more salient for females than males and narrows at the oldest ages. There is no educational disparity in the percent of life with nonlimiting pain. Discussion Education promotes longer life and more pain-free years, but the specific degree of improvement by education varies across demographic groups. More research is needed to explain associations between education and more and less severe and limiting aspects of pain.","Sun, Feinuo Zimmer, Zachary Zajacova, Anna",,"Sun, FN Zimmer, Z Zajacova, A",695,"[Sun, Feinuo; Zimmer, Zachary] Mt St Vincent Univ, Global Aging & Community Initiat, Halifax, NS, Canada.

"Background: During the past decades, beta thalassemia major (TM) and beta thalassemia intermedia (TI) have transformed from a universally fatal disease at a young age into a chronic disease. This advancement is attributed to improved chelation therapy as well as enhanced management strategies, with focused attention on disease and treatment-related complications. Objectives: To describe characteristics of adults with thalassemia as well as treatment modalities, disease and treatment-related complications, and socioeconomic information of the patients. Methods: We preformed a retrospective analysis of 14 adult patients >35 years of age with TM and TI who were treated at our institute, a single center specializing in the care of adult thalassemia patients living in Israel, between the years 2006 and 2016. Results: The median age of patients was 37 years and most patients were transfusion-dependent. The median number of chelation therapeutic lines was three, and 85.7% of patients were treated at one point by combination chelation therapy. Most patients suffered from at least some form of endocrine dysfunction (n=12), and four patients developed overt heart failure. Of the patients, 85% had completed at least a high school education, 78% were employed, and 64.2% were married. Conclusions: Prolonged survival of thalassemia patients in recent years has been accompanied by a new set of challenges for both the patients and the treating staff. Further research is warranted to improve both medical management and the socioeconomic well-being of this unique group of adult thalassemia patients.","Shargian-Alon, Liat Pasvolsky, Oren Raanani, Pia",,"Shargian-Alon, L Pasvolsky, O Raanani, P",767,"[Raanani, Pia] Rabin Med Ctr, Inst Hematol, Beilinson Campus, IL-4941492 Petah Tiqwa, Israel.

"There is a significant body of research relating to augmented reality (AR) uses for learning in the primary and the secondary education sectors across the globe. However, there is not such a substantial amount of work exploring the combination of AR with game-based learning (ARGBL). Although ARGBL has the potential to enable new forms of teaching and transform the learning experience, it remains unclear how ARGBL applications can impact students' motivation, achievements, and learning performance. This study reports a systematic review of the literature on ARGBL approaches in compulsory education considering the advantages, disadvantages, instructional affordances, and/or effectiveness of ARGBL across various primary and secondary education subjects. In total, 21 studies published between 2012 and 2017 in 11 indexed journals were analysed, with 14 studies focusing on primary education and 7 on secondary. The main findings from this review provide the current state of the art research in ARGBL in compulsory education. Trends and the vision towards the future are also discussed, as ARGBL can potentially influence the students' attendance, knowledge transfer, skill acquisition, hands-on digital experience, and positive attitude towards their learning. This review aims to lay the groundwork for educators, technology developers, and other stakeholders involved in the development of literacy programmes for young children by offering new insights with effective advice and suggestions on how to increase student motivation and improve learning outcomes and the learning experience by incorporating ARGBL into their teaching.","Pellas, Nikolaos Fotaris, Panagiotis Kazanidis, Ioannis Wells, David",,"Pellas, N Fotaris, P Kazanidis, I Wells, D",329,"[Pellas, Nikolaos] Univ Aegean, Dept Prod & Syst Design Engn, Ermoupolis, Greece.

"This article reflects on teachers who work in higher education at IFTM, in the city of Uberaba - MG, and from there, highlights some dilemmas of the teaching profession that justify the construction of a ""model"" of continuous teacher transformation. The model proposal is based on current educational policies, scientific knowledge in the area and an empirical investigation. The choice of higher education was due to the fact that it is a recent reality at IFTM and, therefore, presents challenges that are requiring studies and analysis. The research had the dialectical historical materialist method as its theoretical reference. However, the authors sought to contribute with other approaches to facilitate the understanding of the analyzed context full of contradictions. Although the proposal for the creation of Federal Institutes, according to Pacheco (2011), occurred in the perspective of historical dialectical materialism, the institution's strong technical tradition makes the proposal part of a context of contradictions linked to neoliberal and economic expectations. Reflecting on these contradictions makes it possible to understand the context in a different perspective from the usual in the institution. Empirical analysis refers to a context that, when known, reveals its organizational characteristics, the subjects who work there and the organizational culture. It is concluded that reflecting on the function of promoting the development of higher mental activities responsible for the humanization process of man and the specific purpose of school education is inherent to the ""model' of teacher transformation.","Borges, Elisabete Ferreira Marques, Welisson",,"Borges, EF Marques, W",1,"[Borges, Elisabete Ferreira; Marques, Welisson] Inst Fed Triangulo Mineiro, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.",Universidade Federal do Triangulo Mineiro; Instituto Federal do Triangulo Mineiro (IFTM),,,,,2025-01-19,"College education; Teacher Education; Teacher transformation ""model""",10.5902/1984644444237,Article,,1984-6444,elisabete_borges@uol.com.br; welissonmarques@iftm.edu.br,35,,,,YP6KI,,,EDUCACAO,Educacao,Portuguese,,15,gold,,"CIDADE UNIV, BAIRRO CAMOBI, SANTA MARIA, RS 97105-900, BRAZIL",,35,SANTA MARIA,,,J,UNIV FEDERAL SANTA MARIA,2022,,"Borges, EF (corresponding author), Inst Fed Triangulo Mineiro, Uberaba, MG, Brazil.",Education & Educational Research,,0101-9031,EDUCACAO,,,0,"Continuing education of higher education teachers at IFTM, in the city of Uberaba (MG) - ""model"" of transformation",0,0,WOS:000748731200001,47,,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),1
"Background The Global School-based Health Survey showed that 20.6% of Indonesian students aged 13-17 years old were bullied. The proportion was lower than those reported from Southeast Asian countries (28.3-51.0%). School education was reported to contribute to the reduction of bullying, but no similar study has been done in Indonesia. This study aimed to explore the role of school-based education in preventing bullying in high schools in Indonesia. Methods In-depth interviews with principals and focus group discussions with teachers from five schools in Mataram City were conducted in 2018. Data were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Participant observations and document reviews were conducted to verify the data. Results Seven themes emerged: (i) Bullying as a problem; (ii) Causes of bullying; (iii) Effects of bullying; (iv) Curricular interventions; (v) Cultural interventions; (vi) Institutional interventions; and (vii) Challenges and recommendations regarding current interventions. Curricular interventions include Pancasila (state ideology or principles of the state's philosophy) and civic education, and religious education, while cultural interventions include cultural practices and extracurricular activities. The schools provide an enabling environment by maintaining a good physical environment and implementing policies to prevent bullying. These activities promote the prevention of school bullying. Conclusions This study demonstrated that moral education in curriculum and cultural activities are avenues for the prevention of school bullying. The implementation of both religious education and civic education encouraged the creation of values among students. In Indonesia, current interventions should be continued and must be modified to respond with societal changes.","Noboru, Tamaki Amalia, Emmy Hernandez, Paul Michael R.

"This study is one of the first investigations conducted within the Italian school system to capture teachers' perspective, experiences and perceptions about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on school education. It was performed two months after the beginning of lockdown, when online teaching and learning processes were fully in place and had reached a steady state. The paper reports a descriptive analysis together with a network analysis, and the search for causal relationships among the variables that have been investigated. Generally, respondents reported that the reactions of educational institutions and individual teachers were satisfactory, preventing the collapse of the education system in spite of loss of contact with 6-10% of the student population and a significant teacher workload increase that posed individual time management challenges. Although teachers tended to adopt teaching strategies that reproduced standard classroom dynamics, the possibility of operating in this comfort zone generated a positive feeling about using technologies, a perception of increased digital skills mastery and a change in mindset about educational processes. In turn, this led to an increase in the perceived sustainability of online education, with about a third of the teachers expressing the wish to adopt a blended configuration for future teaching activities. Almost all participants recognized the significance of a digital pedagogy and the need to include it in the training curricula to prepare future teachers.","Giovannella, Carlo Passarelli, Marcello Persico, Donatella",,"Giovannella, C Passarelli, M Persico, D",264,"[Giovannella, Carlo; Passarelli, Marcello; Persico, Donatella] ASLERD, Rome, Italy.

"Human-centered, active-learning approaches can help students develop core competencies in biology and other STEM fields, including the ability to conduct research, use quantitative reasoning, communicate across disciplinary boundaries, and connect science education to pressing social and environmental challenges. Promising approaches for incorporating active learning into biology courses include the use of course-based research, community engagement, and international experiences. Disruption to higher education due to the COVID-19 pandemic made each of these approaches more challenging or impossible to execute. Here, we describe a scalable course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for an animal behavior course that integrates research and community engagement in a remote international experience. Students in courses at two U.S. universities worked with community partners to analyze the behavior of African goats grazing near informal settlements in Western Cape, South Africa. Partners established a relationship with goat herders, and then created 2-min videos of individual goats that differed in criteria (goat sex and time of day) specified by students. Students worked in small groups to choose dependent variables, and then compared goat behavior across criteria using a factorial design. In postcourse surveys, students from both universities indicated overall enthusiasm for the experience. In general, students indicated that the laboratory provided them with ""somewhat more "" of a research-based experience compared with biology laboratories they had taken of similar length, and ""somewhat more "" to ""much more "" of a community-engagement and international experience. Educational benefits were complemented by the fact that international educational partners facing economic hardship due to the pandemic received payment for services. Future iterations of the CURE can focus on goat behavior differences across ecological conditions to help herders increase production in the face of continued environmental and social challenges. More generally, applying the structure of this CURE could facilitate mutually beneficial collaborations with residents of under-resourced areas around the world.","Kay, Adam D.

"Engineering education more and more adopts Challenge Based Learning (CBL). In CBL, students learn in groups by taking on open and challenging projects that draw on a broader STEM knowledge base. The challenges reflect and mimic STEM professional core practices (e.g., higher education) or authentic but pedagogically simplified versions (e.g., secondary education). Challenges also connect to societally relevant themes and issues. CBL thus seems well suited to helping students build a positive STEM identity (seeing oneself and being recognized by others as a STEM person c.q., STEM professional). However, CBL is a very new educational concept with little empirical research yet available. Therefore, this study explores the question of CBL's contribution to STEM identity development at a conceptual level. What, conceptually, can CBL be expected to contribute to STEM identity development? We first explore the concept of CBL as it is currently defined to find its strengths and weaknesses and improve it. We then look for empirical evidence on the effects of conceptually akin education (such as design-based learning and project-based learning) on STEM identities. When learning effects can be traced using educational theories to conceptual features they share with CBL, these can be building blocks for our modeling of CBL's contribution to the development of STEM identities. Current definitions of CBL were found to be purely enumerative and did not clearly distinguish CBL from related concepts such as problem-based learning (PBL) or Design-Based Learning (DBL). A new definition for CBL is proposed that is based on an underlying pedagogical vision. It is concluded that CBL and related forms of education can be expected to facilitate the construction of STEM identities, primarily through a combination of a motivation boost, a higher perception of competence and the enjoyable and experiential orientation to STEM that it provides students. However, CBL seems limited with respect to the development of STEM identities in vocational or higher education.","Taconis, Ruurd Bekker, Tilde",1144702,"Taconis, R Bekker, T",,"[Taconis, Ruurd] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven Sch Educ, Eindhoven, Netherlands.

"The impacts of science are felt across all socio-ecological levels, ranging from the individual to societal. In order to adapt or respond to scientific discoveries, novel technologies, or biomedical or environmental challenges, a fundamental understanding of science is necessary. However, antiscientific rhetoric, mistrust in science, and the dissemination of misinformation hinder the promotion of science as a necessary and beneficial component of our world. Scientists can promote scientific literacy by establishing dialogues with nonexperts, but they may find a lack of formal training as a barrier to public engagement. To address this, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) launched the Art of Science Communication course in 2015 in order to provide scientists at all career stages with introductory science communication training. In 2020, we conducted a retrospective survey of former participants to evaluate how the course had impacted participants' science communication behaviors and their confidence engaging with nonexperts, as well as other benefits to their professional development. We found that scientists were significantly more likely to communicate with nonexpert audiences following the course compared to before (77% versus 51%; P < 0.0001). In addition, quantitative and qualitative data suggested that scientists were more confident in their ability to communicate science after completing the course (median of 8, standard deviation [SD] of 0.98 versus median of 5, SD of 1.57; P < 0.0001). Qualitative responses from participants supported quantitative findings. This suggested that the Art of Science Communication course is highly effective at improving the confidence of scientists to engage with the public and other nonexpert audiences regardless of career status. These data-driven perspectives provide a rationale for the implementation of broadly accessible science communication training programs that promote public engagement with science. The impacts of science are felt across all socio-ecological levels, ranging from the individual to societal. In order to adapt or respond to scientific discoveries, novel technologies, or biomedical or environmental challenges, a fundamental understanding of science is necessary.","Swords, Christina M.

"IntroductionBioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of computational and biological sciences that focuses on the analysis and interpretation of large biological data sets. Although recognized as essential in the life sciences, bioinformatics is not commonly integrated in undergraduate life science education programs. Based on a national survey in 2016, the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education (NIBLSE) published a community-sourced set of core competencies in bioinformatics education. The survey also identified barriers that prevent incorporation of these competencies into the curriculum. In the current study, the NIBLSE group reports the findings of a new survey to 509 life science educators across the US in 2022 to identify current barriers of bioinformatics integration and to determine if the landscape of bioinformatics education has changed since the 2016 survey.ResultsSimilar to previous results, a majority of respondents who currently teach bioinformatics or plan to teach bioinformatics report barriers. The top two barriers reported are students lacking prerequisite skills/knowledge and instructors lacking time to restructure course content. As in 2016, women reported experiencing barriers to bioinformatics teaching significantly more often than men; faculty from underrepresented minority backgrounds reported barriers more often than non-URM faculty; and educators at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) reported barriers more frequently than colleagues at non-MSIs. For additional insight into the barriers facing these educators, we conducted focus groups which provided qualitative data that supported the survey findings and revealed common themes including faculty perceptions of the relevance of bioinformatics in the curriculum. Despite the perceived value of bioinformatics education, many focus group members cited lack of student preparation and interest, and technological access as barriers. Participants also discussed how professional development and community support would enhance and sustain bioinformatics teaching.DiscussionTaken all together, this study indicates that challenges remain, which vary among faculty types and settings, but that more educators are attempting to integrate bioinformatics into life sciences education. In summary, our results suggest that redoubled efforts to provide training and community support to life sciences faculty is necessary.","Drew, Jennifer Morgan, William Galindo, Sebastian Kleinschmit, Adam J.

"21st-century skills are key words which have been most searched in recent past. Yet, there seems to be amiss on how teachers should be prepared to teach 21st-century skills. Limited research insights imply lack of actionable inputs for design of teacher education programmes. Thus, this study supports the call by reviewing 55 relevant studies, using the systematic literature review (SLR) approach. This study employed a stringent search protocol to confine search to two popular databases-Scopus and Web of Science (WOS). The authors identified two emerging themes and six sub-themes. The three sub-themes under the first theme upskilling and reskilling of in-service teachers in 21st-century skills are: (1). training initiatives, (2). teachers' experiences in teaching 21st-century skills, and (3). teachers' perceptions and skill assessment. The other three sub-themes under the second theme professional development of pre-service teachers and 21st-century skills are: (1). pedagogical approaches, (2). technology-based teaching-learning of 21st-century skills, and (3). experience, competence and proficiency in 21st-century skills. Findings suggest the need to focus on targeted interventions, pedagogical tools and resources and peer-based learning, and recommend expanding the list of keywords searched under this study by including specific 21st century skills such as creativity to add a new dimension to their review.","Almazroa, Hiya Alotaibi, Wadha",7365,"Almazroa, H Alotaibi, W",,"[Almazroa, Hiya; Alotaibi, Wadha] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Educ, Riyadh 11564, Saudi Arabia.",Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University,,,,,2025-01-19,21st-century skills; in-service teachers; pre-service teachers; professional development; teacher education; teaching-learning process; systematic literature review,10.3390/su15097365,Review,,2071-1050,hmalmazroa@pnu.edu.sa; whalotaibi@pnu.edu.sa,,,,,G2RL8,20-1ST CENTURY SKILLS; DIGITAL GAME DESIGN; PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; STEM EDUCATION; TECHNOLOGY; RECOMMENDATIONS; IMPLEMENTATION; PERCEPTIONS; CLASSROOM; LANGUAGE,9,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,English,,87,gold,"Almazroa, Hiya/0000-0002-4888-6723","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",APR 28,25,BASEL,,,J,MDPI,2023,"Almazroa, Hiya/HOH-1955-2023","Almazroa, H (corresponding author), Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Educ, Riyadh 11564, Saudi Arabia.",Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,SUSTAINABILITY,,,11,Teaching 21st Century Skills: Understanding the Depth and Width of the Challenges to Shape Proactive Teacher Education Programmes,18,77,WOS:000987690700001,15,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),13
"Background According to the Committee on STEM Education, K-12 science students need access to learning experiences that promote collaboration and engagement. To fill that void, we need to develop activities that stimulate engaged learning and scaffold effective collaboration. K-12 teacher candidates see value in utilizing games for this purpose. Specifically, tabletop science games can help teachers engage students in science learning and scaffold collaboration. Aim For this study, we designed a collaborative, STEM-themed card game called MOUNTAIN RESCUE and explored its capacity to promote engaged learning and collaboration. Method Four groups of STEM campers (n = 14) in a suburban Mid-Atlantic region played MOUNTAIN RESCUE. All groups had a mix of boys and girls. Play-testers ranged from 10-13 years old. The tabletop game took approximately 30-minutes. During gameplay, players embodied unique STEM roles: physicist, chemist, structural engineer, and electrical engineer. They collaborated to solve challenges related to electricity, physics, chemistry, and engineering design. Discourse was audio-recorded throughout gameplay. Immediately after gameplay, self-report survey data were collected to assess flow and perceptions of collaborative learning. Results Findings demonstrated that the game promoted engagement and collaboration. Specifically, students had a flow-like experience and felt positively about the game's value for collaborative learning. Utterances demonstrating active engagement and constructive thinking became more group-focused over time. Conclusion This study contributes to science education by demonstrating potential benefits of a well-designed, low-tech, science learning environment or-in other words-a tabletop game.","Bressler, Denise M.

"Despite the widespread advocacy for the integration of arts and humanities (A&H) into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education on an international scale, teachers face numerous obstacles in practically integrating A&H into STEM teaching (IAT). To tackle the challenges, a comprehensive five-stage framework for teacher professional development programs focussed on IAT has been developed. Through the use of a qualitative case study approach, this study outlines the shifts in a participant teacher's self-efficacy following their exposure to each stage of the framework. The data obtained from interviews and reflective analyses were analyzed using a seven-stage inductive method. The findings have substantiated the significant impact of a teacher professional development program based on the framework on teacher self-efficacy, evident in both individual performance and student outcomes observed over eighteen months. The evolution of teacher self-efficacy in IAT should be regarded as an open and multi-level system, characterized by interactions with teacher knowledge, skills and other entrenched beliefs. Building on our research findings, an enhanced model of teacher professional learning is proposed. The revised model illustrates that professional learning for STEAM teachers should be conceived as a continuous and sustainable process, characterized by the dynamic interaction among teaching performance, teacher knowledge, and teacher beliefs. The updated model further confirms the inseparable link between teacher learning and student learning within STEAM education. This study contributes to the existing body of literature on teacher self-efficacy, teacher professional learning models and the design of IAT teacher professional development programs.","Jiang, Haozhe Chugh, Ritesh Zhai, Xuesong Wang, Ke Wang, Xiaoqin",1162,"Jiang, HZ Chugh, R Zhai, XS Wang, K Wang, XQ",,"[Jiang, Haozhe; Zhai, Xuesong] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Educ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.

"The ""leaky pipeline"" with regard to students' engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) has triggered extensive research to understand and prevent students dropping out from STEM. To boost enrolment and interest in STEM fields, integrated STEM (iSTEM) education could be harnessed by providing students with relevant challenges. This study investigated (1) the evolution of affective outcomes regarding science and mathematics over time in traditional education, (2) the impact of an iSTEM curriculum on affective outcomes with regard to science and mathematics, and (3) the differential effectiveness of the iSTEM curriculum regarding student characteristics. Therefore, an iSTEM intervention was developed and evaluated over the course of 2 years. In total, 859 grade 9 students, distributed across 39 different Belgian schools, participated in the longitudinal study. The results of multilevel analyses show that students' attitudes, motivation, and self-efficacy with regard to science and mathematics tend to become less positive over time in traditional education. On the other hand, iSTEM education had positive effects on attitudes towards science and mathematics. However, negative results were observed with regard to motivation and self-efficacy outcomes. In addition, intervention effects differed for boys and girls and for students at different socioeconomic status levels. Our results indicate that iSTEM has the potential to improve students' attitudes towards STEM, but that we should be careful with regard to the implementation of this approach in terms of student motivation and self-efficacy.","De Loof, Haydee Boeve-de Pauw, Jelle Van Petegem, Peter",,"De Loof, H Boeve-de Pauw, J Van Petegem, P",1291,"[De Loof, Haydee; Boeve-de Pauw, Jelle; Van Petegem, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Dept Training & Educ Sci, Res Unit Edubron, Antwerp, Belgium.",University of Antwerp,,,,,2025-01-19,Attitudes towards STEM; Effectiveness; Integrated STEM; STEM motivation; STEM self-efficacy,10.1007/s10763-021-10159-0,Article,AUG 2021,1573-1774,haydee.deloof@uantwerpen.be; jelle.boeve-depauw@uantwerpen.be; peter.vanpetegem@uantwerpen.be,1313,,Flemish government agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT) [STEM@School],We wish to express our gratitude to the Flemish government agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT) for funding the project STEM@School and thereby making this study possible.,4O1XD,SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; SCIENCE-CAREER; EFFICACY; TECHNOLOGY; MOTIVATION; ATTITUDES; GENDER; IMPLEMENTATION; ASPIRATIONS,7,INT J SCI MATH EDUC,Int.

"Problem solving is important to many activities, both in a learning context and in everyday tasks. We can be challenged to solve what later turn out to be very simple problems. By understanding more about these challenges and what occurs at a cognitive level during the problem-solving process, we can better support the development of problem-solving skills. Spatial ability has been shown to be related to the ability to develop accurate and schematic mental representations of problems during the problem-solving process. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of spatial ability in solving word problems in mathematics among a cognitively diverse sample of engineering students. A set of five word problems, a test of mental rotation and set of five questions testing the core mathematical competencies needed to solve the word problems were administered to 115 first year engineering students. Using a knowledge framework for problem solving, key aspects of representation were extracted from solutions to the word problems and combined to create a mental representation scale. A large and significant correlation was measured between mental rotation and problem representation, larger than the correlation between spatial ability and problem-solving. Mental representation was found to mediate the relation between spatial ability and word problem-solving. This relation was not found to be significantly moderated by core competency in mathematics. For high levels of core competency only, there was an interaction between spatial ability and core competency.","Duffy, Gavin Sorby, Sheryl Bowe, Brian",1346474,"Duffy, G Sorby, S Bowe, B",,"[Duffy, Gavin] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Dublin, Ireland.

"This article explores and wrestles with the various discourses that arise when considering why it is important to advise students from an assets-based and holistic approach into science-related majors and careers. Our hope is to inform how and why it is important to advise students into science-related careers, specifically, and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, more generally, from an ethical and justice-oriented approach. We begin with a review of empirical literature that highlights the different approaches to advising and the challenges racially and gender-minoritized students often face in STEM fields. We then review contemporary research from science education that document the hostilities that racially and gender-minoritized students experience in undergraduate and graduate science programs. We find the intersection of these two subfields to be productive for elucidating multilevel, context-dependent strategies, which can redress the inexcusable and alarming underrepresentation and exclusion of racially minoritized peoples in science programs and careers in the United States. We end by contemplating the ethical question of how science programs, careers, and the broader field would need to change, to keep historically minoritized students from experiencing further material and epistemological violence. We argue that, without this reimagination, even the most effective advising models will only ensure that more racially and gender-minoritized students are sacrificed on the altar of ""equality"" for the sake of the economic and geopolitical needs of the state.","Suarez, Enrique Beatty, Cameron C.",,"Suárez, E Beatty, CC",1299,"[Suarez, Enrique] Univ Massachusetts, Coll Educ, Teacher Educ & Curriculum Studies, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.

"IntroductionThe under representation of women in STEM fields is a persistent issue worldwide. In China, although women have made significant progress in pursuing STEM degrees in recent years, they continue to face challenges in the workforce. Given the importance of the self-perceived employability (SPE) of female STEM students in China, the research questions are: How do curriculum experience, extracurricular experience, and faculty supportive activities affect the SPE of female STEM students in Chinese universities? To what extent does university stratification affect the relationship between college experience and female STEM students' SPE?MethodsWe analyzed the 2018 data of the Chinese College Student Survey (CCSS) consisting of a sample of 59,066 students, and six focus group interviews.ResultsThe findings suggest that curriculum experience, extracurricular experience and faculty supportive activities have a positive impact on the SPE of female students, but the gender gap in SPE is still valid as reflected by the fact that women have lower SPE than men in each tier of universities and that men benefit more in terms of the increase in SPE from most types of college activities and support except academic ones.DiscussionThis study reveals that the different tiers of universities in China affect female students' SPE in different ways, and provides valuable evidence for academic as well as university administrators and policymakers regarding how college experience affect women and how university stratification can affect female students' college experience and their career expectations and paths.","Wen, Wen Zhou, Lu Hu, Die Zhang, Mingyu Yan, Zehua Tang, Xiaofeng",1282934,"Wen, W Zhou, L Hu, D Zhang, MY Yan, ZH Tang, XF",,"[Wen, Wen; Zhou, Lu; Tang, Xiaofeng] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"First-generation college students (FGCSs) are a growing population in undergraduate education. Research on FGCS primarily focuses on the challenges and barriers they encounter in college. While important, this literature offers a limited view of FGCS as learners. Moreover, minimal literature has examined these students' lived experiences within sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This study explores the learning experiences of FGCS (N = 17) in undergraduate STEM programs at a mid-sized, private, predominantly white institution. Guided by the frameworks of intersectionality and social cognitive career theory, the researchers utilized a qualitative, phenomenological research methodology to hear the perspectives of FGCS to and to identify problematic higher educational structures in STEM. Findings point to an elitist stance underlying STEM programs based in general disciplinary norms that restricted FGCS access to STEM majors and careers across social, academic, and professional elements of the academic experience. FGCS who were multiply minoritized based upon race, gender, and social class experienced the compounding of marginalization, and academic success and persistence came at a personal cost. Students also reported relying predominantly on personal strengths and motivations to overcome elitism in STEM rather than on institutional supports. Findings also highlight the variation in the first-generation experience and identify the unique barriers FGCS encounter within STEM fields. Implications for dismantling inequitable structures for higher education in STEM attending to the social, academic, and professional inclusion of FGCS.","Marco-Bujosa, Lisa M.

"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to remote learning, heightening scrutiny of open-book examinations (OBEs) versus closed-book examinations (CBEs) within science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEM) education. This study evaluates the efficacy of OBEs compared to CBEs on student performance and perceptions within STEM subjects, considering the emerging influence of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.MethodsAdhering to PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review analysed peer-reviewed articles published from 2013, focusing on the impact of OBEs and CBEs on university STEM students. Standardised mean differences were assessed using a random effects model, with heterogeneity evaluated by I2 statistics, Cochrane's Q test and Tau statistics.ResultsAnalysis of eight studies revealed mixed outcomes. Meta-analysis showed that OBEs generally resulted in better scores than CBEs, despite significant heterogeneity (I2 = 97%). Observational studies displayed more pronounced effects, with noted concerns over technical difficulties and instances of cheating.DiscussionResults suggest that OBEs assess competencies more aligned with current educational paradigms than CBEs. However, the emergence of LLMs poses new challenges to OBE validity by simplifying the generation of comprehensive answers, impacting academic integrity and examination fairness.ConclusionsWhile OBEs are better suited to contemporary educational needs, the influence of LLMs on their effectiveness necessitates further study. Institutions should prudently consider the competencies assessed by OBEs, particularly in light of evolving technological landscapes. Future research should explore the integrity of OBEs in the presence of LLMs to ensure fair and effective student evaluations.","Mizori, Rasi Sadiq, Muhayman Ahmad, Malik Takreem Siu, Anthony Ahmad, Reubeen Rashid Yang, Zijing Oram, Helen Galloway, James",,"Mizori, R Sadiq, M Ahmad, MT Siu, A Ahmad, RR Yang, ZJ Oram, H Galloway, J",,"[Mizori, Rasi; Sadiq, Muhayman; Ahmad, Malik Takreem; Siu, Anthony; Yang, Zijing; Oram, Helen; Galloway, James] Kings Coll London, Fac Life Sci & Med, GKT Sch Med, London, England.

"The pursuit of science is essential for the progress and development of a nation. However, there is evidence of a persistent decline in the number of students opting for science courses in undergraduate programs across the world. This paper investigated the perceptions of the students regarding the reasons for the dearth of science students and why science students switch their majors after the completion of 12 years of education (Intermediate level) in Pakistan. A sequential mixed-methods analysis comprising a survey of a convenience sample of 101 undergraduate students and qualitative interviews with 6 science faculty were used for data collection in the City of Lahore. The findings from quantitative data analyses indicated that the major factors associated with the dearth of science students are favorite subject (<0.05), lack of access to well-trained science teachers (<0.09), parents' wishes against science subjects (<0.03), and poor grades (<0.001). The qualitative data from science teachers showed that reasons for lack of interest in science subjects include the lack of experts in science fields in Pakistan, the quality of science textbooks, the norm of rote memorization of scientific concepts, the annual examination system (as opposed to semester or quarter) and lack of refresher courses for science faculty. The study concluded that a complex set of individual, interpersonal, and institutional factors act as reasons (barriers or facilitators) for students' lack of interest in science as a field of college-level education.","Khan, Sadef Shiraz, Maria Shah, Gulzar Muzamil, Maham",2277032,"Khan, S Shiraz, M Shah, G Muzamil, M",,"[Muzamil, Maham] Kinnaird Coll Women Univ, Dept Educ, 93 Jail Rd, Lahore 54000, Punjab, Pakistan.

"This case study addresses the pedagogical challenges teachers face in incorporating elements of socioscientific issues (SSI) when planning science and mathematics lessons. In order to effectively plan and teach SSI lessons, teachers must develop pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) specific to unpacking elements of SSI such as identifying an issue that is debatable and relevant to students. lives, employing reflective scientific skepticism, and evaluating multiple perspectives. This study was guided by the following research questions: 1) In what ways, if any, did teachers. knowledge and instructional design of SSI change throughout the intensive series of workshops? 2) What areas of SSI required additional support? To answer our research questions, we analyzed changes in lesson plans from 29 teachers, mostly science and secondary, over the course of three intensive workshops as part of the Integrating STEM in Everyday Life Conference Series. Over the five month period, teachers worked in groups and with mentors to design and implement SSI lessons. Our findings show that teachers demonstrated positive changes in all SSI elements over the course of the workshops. However, deeper analysis reveals that teachers struggled to balance the social and scientific aspects of SSI. Moreover, our analysis suggests that teachers did not focus on the discursive nature of SSI in their lesson plans. Implications of our study include ways in which professional development programs can cultivate teachers. PCK of SSI in order to better support them in planning and implementing SSI lessons.","Minken, Zachary Macalalag, Augusto Z.

"The rise of precision education has encouraged teachers to use intelligent diagnostic systems to understand students' learning processes and provide immediate guidance to prevent students from giving up when facing learning difficulties. However, current research on precision education rarely employs multimodal learning analytics approaches to understand students' learning behaviors. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of teachers intervene based on different modalities of learning analytics diagnosing systems on students' learning behaviors, learning performance, and motivation in STEM collaborative learning activities. We conducted a quasi-experiment with three groups: a control group without any learning analytics system assistance, experimental group 1 with a unimodal learning analytics approach based on image data, and experimental group 2 with a multimodal learning analytics approach based on both image and voice data. We collected students' image or voice data according to the experimental design and employed artificial intelligence techniques for facial expression recognition, eye gaze tracking, and speech recognition to identify students' learning behaviors. The results of this research indicate that teacher interventions, augmented by learning analytics systems, have a significant positive impact on student learning outcomes and motivation. In experimental group 2, the acquisition of multimodal data facilitated a more precise identification and addressing of student learning challenges. Relative to the control group, students in the experimental groups exhibited heightened self-efficacy and were more motivated learners. Moreover, students in experimental group 2 demonstrated a deeper level of engagement in collaborative processes and the behavior associated with constructing knowledge.","Lin, Chia-Ju Wang, Wei-Sheng Lee, Hsin-Yu Huang, Yueh-Min Wu, Ting-Ting",,"Lin, CJ Wang, WS Lee, HY Huang, YM Wu, TT",,"[Lin, Chia-Ju; Wang, Wei-Sheng; Lee, Hsin-Yu; Huang, Yueh-Min] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.

"The maldistribution of family physicians challenges equitable primary care access in Canada. The Theory of Social Attachment suggests that preferential selection and distributed training interventions have potential in influencing physician disposition. However, evaluations of these approaches have focused predominantly on rural underservedness, with little research considering physician disposition in other underserved communities. Accordingly, this study investigated the association between the locations from which medical graduates apply to medical school, their undergraduate preclerkship, clerkship, residency experiences, and practice as indexed across an array of markers of underservedness. We built association models concerning the practice location of 347 family physicians who graduated from McMaster University's MD Program between 2010 and 2015. Postal code data of medical graduates' residence during secondary school, pre-clerkship, clerkship, residency and eventual practice locations were coded according to five Statistics Canada indices related to primary care underservedness: relative rurality, employment rate, proportion of visible minorities, proportion of Indigenous peoples, and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were then developed for each dependent variable (i.e., practice location expressed in terms of each index). Residency training locations were significantly associated with practice locations across all indices. The place of secondary school education also yielded significant relationships to practice location when indexed by employment rate and relative rurality. Education interventions that leverage residency training locations may be particularly influential in promoting family physician practice location. The findings are interpreted with respect to how investment in education policies can promote physician practice in underserved communities.","Grierson, Lawrence Mercuri, Mathew Elma, Asiana Mahmud, Meera Bakker, Dorothy Johnston, Neil Aggarwal, Monica Agarwal, Gina",,"Grierson, L Mercuri, M Elma, A Mahmud, M Bakker, D Johnston, N Aggarwal, M Agarwal, G",641,"[Grierson, Lawrence; Elma, Asiana; Mahmud, Meera; Bakker, Dorothy; Agarwal, Gina] McMaster Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Family Med, 100 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H6, Canada.

"Recently, the whole world has faced the deadliest and dangerous consequences due to the transmission of infectious novel coronavirus (nCov). With the outbreak of COVID-19, the education learners, practitioners, and other stakeholders were at the sake of a loss, as it causes the suspension of physical classes and physical interaction of the learners. In these circumstances, Electronic learning (E-learning), Online learning, and the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools came in handy. It helped the learners in the dissemination of ideas, conducting online classes, making online discussion forums, and taking online examinations. Like the government of each country, the Indian government was also caught off-guard but the existing E-learning infrastructure was able to leverage on while devising plans to tailor them to new situations and launching new ones. The initiatives at the forefront of this noble battle launched by the Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD) includes Diksha, Swayam Prabha Channel, Shiksha Van, E-Pathshala, and National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER). It worth noting that apart from the Indian central government efforts, each state has various online education initiatives that are tailored to their needs. This research evaluated each of these initiatives commenced by central and state governments and present a detailed analysis of most of the relevant initiatives. Additionally, a survey is conducted to get insights of learners in concern to online learning. Despite the issues raised in this learning, the outcomes come to be satisfactorily favoring online learning.","Singh, Madanjit Adebayo, Sulaimon Oyeniyi Saini, Munish Singh, Jaswinder",,"Singh, M Adebayo, SO Saini, M Singh, J",7569,"[Singh, Madanjit; Singh, Jaswinder] Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Amritsar, Punjab, India.

"Aims and objectives: To explore the Chinese nurses' knowledge and attitudes concerning advance care planning (ACP) and their engagement in ACP practice. Background: Nurses' knowledge, attitude, and practice of ACP are important in promoting ACP in patients, but little is known about knowledge, attitudes, and practice of ACP among nurses in countries where there are no national policies or regulations on ACP. Design: A descriptive study with a cross-sectional design. Methods: An online questionnaire survey was distributed to Chinese nurses who attended a national conference. Results: A total of 531 nurses completed the survey and were included in the final analysis. No nurses answered all questions correctly, while 31 (5.8%) answered all the survey questions wrong. The participants were most knowledgeable about the item ""Once ACP is made, the content of advance directives cannot be revoked"" and were least knowledgeable about the item ""ACP is valid only when the patients are well informed of the medical condition"". The implementation of ACP was favored by 92.5% of participants, but only 3.4% of them had actually engaged in all 5 ACP practices listed in the survey. Experience of dealing with death was positively associated with nurses' knowledge concerning ACP. The number of dying patients cared for in the past 6 months, school education of palliative care, knowledge of ACP, and age were related to engagement in the practice of ACP. Conclusion: Chinese nurses have supportive attitudes towards ACP, but they have limited knowledge and little practice in ACP.","Cheng, Qinqin Liu, Xiangyu Li, Xuying Qing, Limin Lin, Qin Wen, Shiwu Chen, Yongyi",151409,"Cheng, QQ Liu, XY Li, XY Qing, LM Lin, Q Wen, SW Chen, YY",,"[Cheng, Qinqin] Cent South Univ, Pain Management Dept, Hunan Canc Hosp, Affiliated Canc Hosp,Xiangya Sch Med, Changsha, Peoples R China.

"Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women in Ghana. Cost-effective tools for the primary and secondary prevention of cervical cancer, such as the Pap test, the HPV DNA test, and the HPV vaccine, are available in hospitals and clinics throughout Ghana. However, participation in cervical cancer prevention behaviors is low among Ghanaian women. Our objective was to determine if there were significant differences in cervical cancer awareness and stigmatizing beliefs about women with cervical cancer between Ghanaian women of different education levels. We surveyed 288 Ghanaian women who were at least 18 years old. Data on the participants' demographic characteristics, awareness of cervical cancer, cervical cancer screening, and the HPV vaccine, beliefs about cervical cancer screening, and stigmatizing beliefs about women with cervical cancer was collected. Chi-square tests for independence and Fisher's exact test of independence were preformed to determine if education level was associated with those factors. Participation in cervical cancer screening and uptake of the HPV vaccine was significantly lower among women with less than a senior high school education. Awareness about cervical cancer, cervical cancer screening, and the HPV vaccine was lower among women with less education. Women with lower levels of education were more likely to agree with the negative statements about cervical cancer screening and stigmatizing beliefs about women with cervical cancer. Cervical cancer education interventions that are tailored for Ghanaian women with different educational levels are needed to increase awareness of and participation in cervical cancer prevention strategies.","Williams, Michelle S.

"This paper extends on six aspects of an article on neoliberal school reforms, their possible influences on schools and school psychologists, and options for dealing with these challenges (Szulevicz, Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Sciences 2018). First, the reductions implied in the neoliberal view of the student as homo economicus and of an ideal student as self-regulated learner are described and alternative views of the student as a person (e.g., homo moralis) and of the ideal student (e.g., as intentional self-developer) are presented. Secondly, several promoting and inhibiting influences on neoliberal school reforms are discussed: competence-based school education, output-oriented school governance, and standardized school performance testing on the one hand, and critical discourses about these phenomena on the other. Third, attention is directed towards impending disadvantages of the aforementioned reforms (e.g., insufficient preparation of students for the fullness of life). Fourth, goals for interventions are discussed (e.g., reducing neoliberal influences on schools, creating an awareness of the disadvantages of neoliberal reforms, forming coalitions to promote alternatives to these reforms). Fifth, some intervention approaches for reaching these goals are considered with special emphasis on different system levels and stakeholders at which these interventions may be targeted (e.g., education policy makers, teachers and parents associations). Sixth, evaluations of the interventions are called for to monitor their effects and to refine the guiding goals, problem analyses, and strategies. In closing, some transferable principles of the preceding approach are highlighted that could be used to better understand and manage other educational problems as well.","Boll, Thomas",,"Boll, T",425,"[Boll, Thomas] Univ Luxembourg, Res Unit INSIDE, Fac Language & Literature Humanities Arts & Educ, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",University of Luxembourg,,,,,2025-01-19,School reforms; Neoliberalism; School psychology; Educational objectives; Psychological development; Critical psychology,10.1007/s12124-018-9419-9,Article,,1936-3567,thomas.boll@uni.lu,437,,,,GR7HT,,3,INTEGR PSYCHOL BEHAV,Integr.

"Background: To date, because of limited budgets and lower incidence of breast cancer, the majority of Asian countries do not have population-based screening programmes, but instead offer opportunistic screening. However, there have been few studies which have assessed the motivators for women attending such programmes and the appropriateness of the programmes in terms of targeting women at risk. Methods: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study of 1,619 women aged 40 to 74 years attending a subsidized opportunistic screening mammogram from October 2011 to October 2013 at a private hospital in Malaysia. Breast cancer risk was estimated using the Gail Model and two-step cluster analysis was used to examine the motivators of attending screening. Results: Although Malaysia comprises 54.5 % Malay, 24.5 % Chinese and 7.3 % Indian, the majority of women in the MyMammo Study were Chinese (70.1 %) and 99.2 % had a <2 % ten-year risk of breast cancer. The most commonly cited barriers were the perception of not being at risk and fear of painful mammography. We found that highly educated women, cited doctors, family and friends as their main motivators. Of those with only secondary school education, their main motivators were doctors. Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest the women attending opportunistic mammography screening in Asia are at low risk of breast cancer and this poses challenges to cost-effective and equitable strategies for cancer control. We propose that to improve uptake of screening mammography, awareness programmes should target both doctors and members of the public.","Hassan, Norhashimah Ho, Weang Kee Mariapun, Shivaani Teo, Soo Hwang",548,"Hassan, N Ho, WK Mariapun, S Teo, SH",,"[Hassan, Norhashimah; Mariapun, Shivaani; Teo, Soo Hwang] Canc Res Initiat Fdn, Sime Darby Med Ctr, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.

"This essay rethinks the gender history and historiography of interwar sub-Saharan Africa by deploying the heuristic device of the 'modern girl' to consider how global circuits of representation and commerce informed this period of gender tumult. This device has been developed by a research group at the University of Washington to understand the global emergence during the 1920s and 1930s of female figures identified by their cosmopolitan look, their explicit eroticism and their use of specific commodities. Previous scholarship has suggested that a black modern girl imbricated in international circuits of images, ideologies and commodities only became visible in southern Africa in the post-Second World War period. Yet, analysis of the black newspaper Bantu World reveals the emergence of such a figure by the early 1930s. The modern girl heuristic helps to situate race as a key category of analysis in scholarship on women and gender in interwar Africa as contemporaries consistently debated her in racial terms. In South Africa, some social observers saw African young women's school education, professional careers and cosmopolitan look as contributing to 'racial uplift'. Others accused the African modern girl of 'prostituting' her sex and race by Imitating white, coloured or Indian women, and by delaying or avoiding marriage, dressing provocatively and engaging in premarital and inter-racial sex. Cosmetics use was one of the most contentious issues surrounding the black modern girl because it drew attention to the phenotypic dimensions of racial distinctions. By analysing a beauty contest in Bantu World together with articles and letters on, and advertisements for, cosmetics, this essay demonstrates how, in white-dominated segregationist South Africa, the modern girl emerged through and posed challenges to categories of race and respectability.","Thomas, Lynn M.",,"Thomas, LM",461,"Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,,"New Orleans, LA",47th Annual Meeting of the African-Studies-Association,"NOV 11-14, 2004",2025-01-19,race; gender; identity; press; South Africa,10.1017/S0021853706002131,Article; Proceedings Paper,,1469-5138,,490,,,,121FF,GENDER,3,J AFR HIST,J.

"Objective: The Supported Employment Demonstration (SED), a multiyear (2016-2022), randomized controlled trial funded by the Social Security Administration, recruited a nontraditional sample of benefits applicants with self-reported or documented mental health conditions who were denied disability benefits and who expressed a desire for employment. This study describes the characteristics of the SED sample at baseline. Methods: The authors analyzed baseline data from the 2,960 eligible enrollees, including responses to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB). Results: A majority of SED enrollees self-identified as female (57%), White (56%), and non-Hispanic (87%). Many were 35 years or older (58%), reported at least a high school education (81%), lived with relatives (69%), had never married (55%), were unemployed (81%), and were poor. Median monthly household income was $1,200. Anxiety disorders (71%), personality disorders (65%), and mood disorders (61%) were prevalent. Enrollees reported a mean +/- SD of 2.5 +/- 1.3 mental health conditions and 3.5 +/- 2.1 general medical conditions. Health-related quality of life was low, relative to national norms: mean scores for the sample were 32.6 +/- 12.5 on the SF-12 mental component summary and 38.3 +/- 13.0 on the physical component summary. Mean scores on the WD-FAB subdomains were more than a SD below norms. Conclusions: At baseline, the SED sample had multiple mental health and general medical conditions, low quality of life, and low functional ability. Despite these challenges, the ongoing SED intervention seeks to build on enrollees' expressed desire for employment.","Borger, Christine Marrow, Jocelyn Drake, Robert E.

"INTRODUCTION: In universal healthcare systems, patients may still encounter financial obstacles from cancer treatments, potentially influencing treatment decision-making. We investigated the relationship between socioeconomic status and treatment decision-making as it pertains to patient values, preferences, and perceived barriers to care for localized prostate cancer.METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of patients undergoing a prostate biopsy for the initial detection of prostate cancer. Sociodemographic variables were collected, with validated instruments used to determine health literacy levels. Patients were divided into two groups using self-reported income; those with a positive identification of prostate cancer underwent additional surveys to ascertain their knowledge of their diagnosis, treatment -related preferences, and socioeconomic barriers to care. Descriptive statistics were used.RESULTS: Of 160 patients, approximately one-third were classified as having low health literacy. Within the low-income group, education levels were lower (34.6% had less than high school education vs. 10.2% in the high-income group) and unemployment rates higher (75.0% unemployed vs. 38.9% in the high-income group). Low-income patients with prostate cancer placed greater importance on indirect out-of-pocket expenses related to treatment (78.3% vs. 33.3%, p=0.001), higher emphasis on treatment-related travel time (50% vs. 15.1%, p=0.004), and more often had difficulty paying for healthcare services in the past (30.9% vs. 9.1%, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower household incomes have unique treatment values and decision-making preferences. They may experience additional challenges and barriers to obtaining cancer care, at least partly related to indirect costs. These findings should be considered when framing prostate cancer treatment discussions and designing patient-facing health information.","Rai, Karnvir S.

"Background: Low-income Americans smoke cigarettes at higher rates and quit less than other groups. Methods: To increase their engagement in and success using evidence-based cessation methods, we tested two interventions using a 2x2 randomized factorial design: (1) telephone navigation to reduce financial strain and address social needs such as food, rent and utility payment; and (2) a specialized tobacco quitline designed for low-income smokers. From June 2017 to November 2020, we enrolled 1,944 low-income smokers in Missouri, USA, recruited through the Missouri 2-1-1 helpline, into the trial. This paper describes recruitment, key characteristics and life circumstances of this high-risk population. Results: After eligibility screening, 1,944 participants completed baseline and were randomized. Participants were racially diverse (58% African American), poor (51% < $10,000 annual pre-tax household income) and many reported less than high school education (30%). They reported a mean of 2.5 unmet social needs, especially childcare and paying bills, had high rates of stress, depressive symptoms and sleep problems, and most were in fair or poor health. There were few differences between these variables, and no differences between tobacco use and cessation variables, across the four study groups and between participants recruited pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Trial recruitment through the 2-1-1 helpline is feasible for reaching a population of low-income smokers. Low-income smokers face myriad daily challenges beyond quitting smoking. Cessation interventions need to account for and address these life circumstances.Y","Garg, Rachel McQueen, Amy Roberts, Christina Butler, Taylor Grimes, Lauren M.

"The Maternal and Child Health Bureau recently revised its measure of family-provider shared decision-making (SDM) to better align with parents' views and the intent of SDM. We sought to assess achievements in meeting the revised measure; examine socio-demographic/health correlates; and determine the relationships between SDM and access to quality health care. We analyzed data for 40,242 children with special health care needs (CSHCN) from the 2009-2010 National Survey of CSHCN and assessed the prevalence of SDM and association with other US CSHCN socio-demographic/health characteristics using bivariate and multivariate methods. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between SDM and having a medical home and preventive medical/dental visits. Approximately 70 % of families of CSHCN perceived themselves as shared decision-makers in their child's care. Families of CSHCN with greater functional limitations had twice the odds of lacking SDM than those never affected. Disparities in attainment rates were noted for families with low versus high income (61 vs. 77 %), less versus more than high school education (59 vs. 73 %), privately insured versus uninsured (76 vs. 57 %), and minority versus white race (63 vs. 74 %). CSHCN with medical homes had 6 times greater odds of perceived SDM and as much as one and a half times the odds of receiving preventive care than CSHCN without a medical home. Major differences in family SDM perceptions are associated with having a medical home, particularly when characterized by family-centered care. Populations of concern are those with more functionally limited children and increased socio-economic challenges.","Smalley, LaQuanta P.

"Background:Identifying cohorts of Caribbean women with HIV infection rates sufficient for inclusion in HIV vaccine efficacy trials has been challenging. HVTN 907 determined the feasibility of identifying and retaining a cohort of women at high risk for HIV acquisition by focusing recruitment on female sex workers (FSWs).Methods:HIV uninfected FSWs, residing in Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, who reported unprotected sex and met previously described more stringent site-specific eligibility criteria, were eligible. Behavioral risk assessment, HIV counseling and testing, and pregnancy testing were performed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months.Results:Among 799 FSWs (264 from Dominican Republic, 334 from Haiti, and 201 from Puerto Rico), the median age was 26 years, with 54% having less than a high school education and 45% having a monthly household income of less than $US 100. Median number of male partners 6 months before screening was 200. Retention at 18 months was 93%. Twelve women became HIV infected, 9 from Haiti. The annualized HIV incidence was 1.07% (95% confidence interval: 0.55% to 1.87%). Pregnancy incidence was 22.5% (95% confidence interval: 21.9% to 29.5%). Statistically significant declines in risk behaviors occurred between screening and the 18-month visit assessment.Discussion:The HVTN 907 study identified a high-risk cohort of women with excellent retention for all 3 sites, despite major challenges especially in Haiti. These results show that a bridging study of a vaccine shown to be efficacious in other clade settings would be possible among FSWs in the region, particularly in Haiti.","Deschamps, Marie M.

"Purpose - To present a national profile of developments in higher education for sustainable development in the Philippines and to analyse a new initiative to accelerate environmental education for sustainable development (EESD) within academic institutions. Design/methodology/approach - This is an evaluative review that examines the design and piloting of an innovative scheme within the Philippine education system. The analysis is situated in relation to the approaches taken by prior initiatives and framed in order to draw out significant challenges, developments, and prospects for EESD at the organizational level. Findings - The paper finds that EESD in the Philippines has an official base in the National Environmental Education Action Plan, which provides a framework to guide higher education. Two national networks promote environmental education, while environmental training and curriculum projects have been supported by government agencies and academic institutions, but without explicit policy support for more widespread changes. In contrast, the Dark Green Schools (DGS) program offers a distinctive ""whole institution"" approach and accreditation system devised in line with the principles of EESD for coherent systemic change. The design and pilot year of the DGS program shows positive potential for ""greening"" academic institutions and the issues that arise in seeking curriculum change, future funding, and formal support at sector level. Originality/value - The DGS is an innovative program to promote ""whole institution"" change for EESD in the Philippines. Whilst similar approaches have been developed in some countries at the level of school education, such initiatives are rare at the level of higher education. This paper therefore includes lessons and findings that help to inform global debate in this important area of EESD in higher education.","Galang, Angelina P.",,"Galang, AP",173,"Miriam Coll, Inst Environm Studies, Quezon City, Philippines.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Higher education; Sustainable development; Educational innovation; Philippines,10.1108/14676371011031892,Article,,,ninagalang@ymail.com,183,,,,V24GS,,2,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

The authors describe the collaborative model their school developed and implemented in 2000 to integrate institution- and community-based interdisciplinary education through a centralized office, the strengths and challenges faced in applying it, the educational outcomes that are being tracked to evaluate its effectiveness, and estimates of funds needed to ensure its success. Core funding of $180,000 is available annually for a centralized office, the keystone of the model described here. With this funding, the office has (1) addressed recruitment, retention, and quality of educators for UME; (2) promoted innovation in education, evaluation, and research; (3) supported development of a comprehensive curriculum for medical school education; and (4) monitored the effectiveness of community-based education programs by tracking product yield and cost estimates needed to generate these programs. The model's Teaching and Learning Database contains information about more than 1,500 educational placements at 165 ambulatory teaching sites (80% in northern New England) involving 320 active preceptors. The centralized office facilitated 36 site visits, 22% of which were interdisciplinary, involving 122 preceptors. A total of 98 follow-up requests by community-based preceptors were fulfilled in 2000. The current submission-to-funding ratio for educational grants is 56%. Costs per educational activity have ranged from $811.50 to $1,938, with costs per preceptor ranging from $101.40 to $217.82. Cost per product (grants, manuscripts, presentations) in research and academic scholarship activities was $2,492. The model allows the medical school to balance institutional and departmental support for its educational programs, and to better position itself for the ongoing changes in the health care system.","Carney, PA Schifferdecker, KE Pipas, CF Fall, LH Poor, DA Peltier, DA Nierenberg, DW Brooks, WB",,"Carney, PA Schifferdecker, KE Pipas, CF Fall, LH Poor, DA Peltier, DA Nierenberg, DW Brooks, WB",610,"Dartmouth Coll Sch Med, Off Community Based Educ & Res, Hanover, NH USA.",Dartmouth College,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1097/00001888-200207000-00005,Article,,1938-808X,Patricia.A.Carney@dartmouth.edu,620,,,,574YE,CARE; STUDENTS,7,ACAD MED,Acad.

"Objective: To evaluate the prevalence, co-occurrence, sex differences, and functional correlates of DSM-5 psychiatric disorders in 15-year-old adolescents born extremely preterm. Method: The Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns (ELGAN) Study is a longitudinal study of children born <28 weeks gestation. At age 15, 670 adolescents completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID), the Youth Self-Report, a disability scale of participation in social roles, and cognitive testing. Parents completed a family psychiatric history questionnaire. Results: The most prevalent psychiatric disorders were anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and major depression. More girls met criteria for anxiety than boys. Though 66% of participants did not meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder, 15% met criteria for 1, 9% for 2, and 8% for >= 3 psychiatric disorders. Participants with >= 2 psychiatric disorders were more likely to have repeated a grade, to have an individualized educational program, and to have a lower nonverbal IQ than those with no psychiatric disorders. Participants with any psychiatric disorder were more likely to use psychotropic medications; to have greater cognitive and functional impairment; and to have mothers who were single, were on public health insurance, and had less than a high school education. Finally, a positive family psychiatric history was identified more frequently among adolescents with >= 3 psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: Among adolescents born extremely preterm, anxiety, major depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were the most prevalent psychiatric disorders at age 15. Adolescents with >1 psychiatric disorder were at increased risk for multiple functional and participatory challenges.","Frazier, Jean A. Cochran, David Kim, Sohye Jalnapurkar, Isha Joseph, Robert M.

"Background: Home care workers (HCWs), who include home health aides and personal care attendants, frequently care for adults with heart failure (HF). Despite substantial involvement in HF care, prior qualitative studies have found that HCWs lack training and confidence, which creates challenges for this workforce and potentially for patient care. Herein, we quantified the prevalence of HF training among HCWs and determined its association with job satisfaction. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of agency-employed HCWs caring for HF patients across New York, NY from 2018-2019. HF training was assessed with, ""Have you received prior HF training?"" Job satisfaction was assessed with, ""How satisfied are you with your job?"" The association between HF training and job satisfaction was determined with robust poisson regression. Results: 323 HCWs from 23 agencies participated; their median age was 50 years (IQR: 37,58), 94% were women, 44% were non-Hispanic Black, 23% were Hispanic, 78% completed >= high school education, and 72% were foreign-bom. They had been caregiving for a median of 8.5 years (IQR: 4,15) and 73% had cared for 1-5 HF patients. Two-thirds received none/a little HF training and 82% felt satisfied with their job. In a fully adjusted model, HCWs with some/a lot of HF training had 14% higher job satisfaction than those with none/a little HF training (aPR 1.14; 95% CI 1.03-1.27). Conclusions: The majority of HCWs have not received HF training. HF training was associated with higher job satisfaction, suggesting that HF training programs may improve HCWs' experience caring for this patient population.","Sterling, Madeline R.

"Worldwide, the medical challenge brought by the pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus (COVID-19/COronaVIrusDisease-2019) is overlapping with the challenge of continuing the educational process in schools and universities and this article highlights the situation regarding the studies at university. In Romania, the courses in school education and higher education have been suspended since March 2020, as a preventive measure against the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). After the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was declared, in Romania the state of emergency was established in order to limit the infection with coronavirus disease and, for this purpose, measures restricting the free movement off all persons were regulated. In this uncertain and unpredictable context regarding the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on education worldwide, with schools and universities affected by a level of disruption, without precedent in the past, it is essential and imperative for education to continue. This article discusses the need and the possibility of continuing the learning process even if schools and universities are closed and face to face courses are suspended, using online resources, forcing an online education, and also the juridical implications regarding the choice of this path.

"We use education management service is to ensure the normal development of education management in Colleges and universities, to support and guarantee its role. In the establishment of the corresponding system, we are involved in all aspects of the problem, which is very complex. In theory, we include school education, network security and social environment and other aspects. Based on these factors and causality, we propose a simulation model which can dynamically analyze the role of students in education management services. Our simulation results are in good agreement with the actual results, and we propose an improved scheme based on the experimental results. With the development of science and technology, artificial intelligence technology is also in continuous progress, now all fields of talent at all levels are studying artificial intelligence technology, and have different views on it. From the current trend, we can see that in the future, artificial intelligence technology will certainly involve all aspects of people's life, and play an obvious role in improving people's quality of life. At the same time, artificial intelligence technology can also be applied in the education industry. The combination of human intelligence technology and education management technology makes the management of education more leisurely and active, and can promote the development of education management. However, with the integration of artificial intelligence technology and education management technology, there will be a series of negative problems and privacy leakage risks, which also brings some challenges and difficulties to the education management industry.","Wang, Yashu",103884,"Wang, YS",,"[Wang, Yashu] East China Normal Univ, Fac Educ, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",East China Normal University,,,,,2025-01-19,Artificial intelligence age; Educational management; College students; The system dynamics; Simulation,10.1016/j.micpro.2021.103884,Article; Retracted Publication,JAN 2021,1872-9436,wangyashu_essay@163.com,,,,,RY2RH,,,MICROPROCESS MICROSY,Microprocess.

"Introduction: The transition from medical student to intern is inherently stressful, with potentially negative consequences for both interns and patients. Methods: We describe Internship Boot Camp, an innovative course specifically designed to prepare fourth-year medical students for the transition from medical school to internship. An intensive 1-week course, Internship Boot Camp has simulated, longitudinal patient-care scenarios that use high-fidelity medical simulation, standardized patients, procedural task trainers, and problem-based learning to help students apply their knowledge and develop a framework for response to the challenges they will face as interns. Results: In March 2007, 12 students participated in the course as an elective in their final year of medical school, and the other 28 students in their class did not. After beginning internship and 5 to 7 months after the completion of Internship Boot Camp, all 40 former students were asked to complete a blinded survey about their preparation for internship. The overall response rate for the survey was 80%. Of responders to an open-ended question about the aspects of medical school training that best prepared them for internship, 89% (8 of 9) of course participants listed ""Internship Boot Camp."" The next highest response (""subinternship"") was given by 45% (9 of 20) of nonparticipants and 33% (3 of 9) of course participants. Discussion: Internship Boot Camp is a unique learning environment that is recalled by participants as the most helpful, of all components of their medical school education, in preparation for internship.

"The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) necessitates promoting AI education at the K-12 level. However, educating young learners to become AI literate citizens poses several challenges. The components of AI literacy are ill-defined and it is unclear to what extent middle school students can engage in learning about AI as a sociotechnical system with socio-political implications. In this paper we posit that students must learn three core domains of AI: technical concepts and processes, ethical and societal implications, and career futures in the AI era. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) workshop that aimed to integrate middle school students' learning of the three domains. We found that after the workshop, most students developed a general understanding of AI concepts and processes (e.g., supervised learning and logic systems). More importantly, they were able to identify bias, describe ways to mitigate bias in machine learning, and start to consider how AI may impact their future lives and careers. At exit, nearly half of the students explained AI as not just a technical subject, but one that has personal, career, and societal implications. Overall, this finding suggests that the approach of incorporating ethics and career futures into AI education is age appropriate and effective for developing AI literacy among middle school students. This study contributes to the field of AI Education by presenting a model of integrating ethics into the teaching of AI that is appropriate for middle school students.","Zhang, Helen Lee, Irene Ali, Safinah DiPaola, Daniella Cheng, Yihong Breazeal, Cynthia",,"Zhang, H Lee, I Ali, S DiPaola, D Cheng, YH Breazeal, C",290,"[Zhang, Helen; Cheng, Yihong] Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ & Human Dev, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.

"Background: Cognitive dysfunction is common in persons seeking medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and may hinder many addiction-related services. Brief but accurate screening measures are needed to efficiently assess cognitive dysfunction in these resource-limited settings. The study aimed to develop a brief predictive risk score tailored for use among patients in drug treatment. Methods: The present study examined predictors of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), objectively assessed via the NIH Toolbox, among 173 patients receiving methadone as MOUD at an urban New England drug treatment facility. Predictors of MCI were identified in one subsample using demographic characteristics, medical chart data, and selected items from the Brief Inventory of Neuro-Cognitive Impairment (BINI). Predictors were crossvalidated in a second subsample using logistic regression. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses determined an optimal cut-off score for detecting MCI. Results: A cognitive dysfunction risk score (CDRS) was calculated from patient demographics (age 50+, nonWhite ethnicity, less than high school education), medical and substance use chart data (history of head injury, overdose, psychiatric diagnosis, past year polysubstance use), and selected self-report items (BINI). The CDRS discriminated acceptably well, with a ROC curve area of 70.6 %, and correctly identified 78 % of MCI cases (sensitivity = 87.5 %; specificity = 55.6 %). Conclusions: The CDRS identified patients with cognitive challenges at a level likely to impede treatment engagement and/or key outcomes. The CDRS may assist in efficiently identifying patients with cognitive dysfunction while requiring minimal training and resources. Larger validation studies are needed in other clinical settings.","Copenhaver, Michael M. Sanborn, Victoria Shrestha, Roman Mistler, Colleen B. Sullivan, Matthew C.

"Background In the new Sustainable Development Goal 4, quality of education defined as equity and inclusion alongside traditional learning outcomes, has replaced the narrow goal of access to primary education stipulated in the Millennium Development Goal 2. Since 2000, considerable progress has been made towards improving access to school for children in India, yet questions remain regarding not just children with disabilities' access and acquisition of basic learning skills, but also completion of learning cycles. Methods and findings Between November, 2, 2011 and June 20th 2012, we interviewed 1294 households about activity limitations and functioning difficulties associated with a health problem among all family members using a validated screening instruments, as well as questions about access, retention and barriers to education. We found that vulnerable children, particularly children with disabilities are less likely to start school and more likely to drop out of school earlier and before completing their high school education than non-disabled children, showing that the learning process is not inclusive in practice. The gap is wider for girls, economically deprived children, or children from households where the head is uneducated. Conclusions Firstly, in order to fill the existing knowledge gap on education of children with disabilities in line with SDG4, not only is there a necessity for relevant data with regards to learning outcomes, but also an urgent requirement for more innovative information pertaining to relational aspects of learning that reflect inclusion. Secondly, a stronger understanding of the implications of early assessment would further promote equity in education. Finally, research should tackle learning as a complex and dynamic phenomenon. Education needs to fulfil its instrumental value, but must also re-claim its intrinsic value that often gets watered down in the journey from policies to implementation.","Bakhshi, Parul Babulal, Ganesh M.

"Background The co-occurrence of anaemia and stunting (CAS) presents acute development and morbidity challenges to children particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Evidence on the effect of child feeding recommendations on CAS is scarce.Methods We used data from 22 recent Demographic and Health Surveys in SSA countries to examine the association between caregivers' implementation of recommendations on infant and young child feeding and the CAS in their 6-to 23-mo-old children.Results Overall, in multiple logistic regression models, child feed index score, high wealth of household, increasing household size, household head with at least secondary school education, improved sanitation of household, an increase in caregiver's age and caregiver's with at least secondary education were associated with lower odds of CAS (i.e., AOR: 0.86; 95% CI; 0.84 - 0.88: 0.75; 0.69 - 0.82: 0.98, 0.98 - 0.99: 0.76, 0.70 - 0.83: 0.81, 0.74 - 0.87: 0.87, 0.81 - 0.94: 0.69, 0.62 - 0.77 respectively). Having a diarrhoea in the past 2 weeks and having fever in the past month were associated with higher odds of CAS (AOR:1.1, 95% CI; 1.0 - 1.2: 1.1, 1.0 - 1.2, respectively). Results from the decision tree analysis showed that the educational level of women was the most important predictor of CAS, followed by child feeding score, the level of education of the family head and state of drinking water.Conclusion The results buttress the importance of interventions aimed at improving feeding practices and parental educational as a vehicle to improve children's nutritional status.","Christian, Aaron Kobina Afful-Dadzie, Eric Marquis, Grace S.",9,"Christian, AK Afful-Dadzie, E Marquis, GS",,"[Christian, Aaron Kobina] Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, Legon, Accra, Ghana.

"Background: The Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction recommended the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which aims to achieve substantial risk reduction and to avoid various disaster-associated losses, including human lives and livelihoods, based on the lessons from the implementation of the Hyogo framework. However, the recommendations did not lay enough stress on the school and the Safe School Concept, which are the core components of a disaster response. Objective: To raise the issue of the importance of schools in disaster response. Results: For human capacity building to avoid the damage caused by natural disasters, we should focus on the function of schools in the community and on school health framework. Schools perform a range of functions, which include being a landmark place for evacuation, acting as a participatory education hub among communities (students are usually from the surrounding communities), and being a sustainable source of current disaster-related information. In 2007, the Bangkok Action Agenda (BAA) on school education and disaster risk reduction (DRR) recommended the integration of DRR into education policy development, the enhancement of participatory mechanisms to improve DRR education, and the extension of DRR education from schools to communities. Based on our discussion and the recommendations of the BAA, we suggest that our existing challenges are to construct a repository of disaster-related lessons, develop training materials based on current information drawn from previous disasters, and disseminate the training to schools and communities. Conclusions: Schools linked with school health can provide good opportunities for DRR with a focus on development of school health policy and a community-oriented participatory approach.","Takahashi, Kenzo Kodama, Mitsuya Gregorio, Ernesto R., Jr. Tomokawa, Sachi Asakura, Takashi Waikagul, Jitra Kobayashi, Jun",29106,"Takahashi, K Kodama, M Gregorio, ER Tomokawa, S Asakura, T Waikagul, J Kobayashi, J",,"[Takahashi, Kenzo; Kodama, Mitsuya; Tomokawa, Sachi; Asakura, Takashi; Kobayashi, Jun] Japanese Consortium Global Sch Hlth Res, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.

"University mathematics studies are known for high dropout especially in the freshmen year. This dropout is often traced back to the excessive demands freshmen have to face. Research aimed at identifying students' characteristics that enable them to overcome the demands, for example through cognitive abilities, motivational constructs or self-beliefs. In this paper, we take a different perspective and suggest to include a construct that has not been considered in university mathematics education so far: mathematical resilience. Mathematical resilience is a well-established construct in school education to describe students' attitude in handling everyday educational challenges like setbacks or frustration. We aim to transfer the construct to university mathematics education. Based on a literature review, we argue that the weekly mathematics assignments (i.e., compulsory exercises) pose a major emotional challenge for freshmen as they require advanced mathematical skills like proving, which students only scarcely learn at school. Failing at those mathematics exercises can lead to lasting frustration and, eventually, dropout. Mathematical resilience may thus be a relevant construct to consider when investigating dropout. We present a novel instrument measuring mathematical resilience against mathematics exercises. Findings of an empirical study with 424 mathematics freshmen confirm that mathematics assignments are in fact viewed as the most frustrating everyday challenge. Moreover, the data provide evidence on the validity and reliability of the novel instrument. The results show that mathematical resilience and the corresponding instrument contribute to research on academic success and failure of mathematics freshmen considering the specific conditions of university mathematics studies.","Neumann, Irene Jeschke, Colin Heinze, Aiso",,"Neumann, I Jeschke, C Heinze, A",307,"[Neumann, Irene; Jeschke, Colin; Heinze, Aiso] Leibniz Inst Sci & Math Educ IPN, Olshausenstr 62, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur die Padagogik der Naturwissenschaften und Mathematik an der Universitat Kiel (IPN),,,,,2025-01-19,Mathematical Resilience; Academic Success; Dropout; Mathematics Freshmen,10.1007/s13138-020-00177-w,Article,NOV 2020,1869-2699,ineumann@ipn.uni-kiel.de,333,,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,WB9KW,ACADEMIC SELF-CONCEPT; ACHIEVEMENT GOALS; HIGHER EDUCATION; BIG 5; PERSONALITY; PREDICTORS; PERFORMANCE; COLLEGE; MODEL; EFFICACY,2,J MATH-DIDAKT,J.

"Background: Parent mentors are a potential community-based mechanism for delivering behavioral interventions. For communities at a higher risk of obesity and challenges with access to care, such as migrant and seasonal farm workers, this may be an effective intervention for obesity. This study examined the effect of parent mentors on weight outcomes. Methods: This randomized clinical trial assigned parents of 2- to 5 year-old children enrolled in Head Start 1:1:1 to control, a parent mentor teaching We Can!, or a parent mentor teaching an intervention derived from positive deviance methods. The parent mentor arms were designed to have weekly interactions and monthly community meetings over 6 months. The primary outcome was change in adiposity, as measured by body mass indices. Results: We randomized 188 parents, and 155 completed the 6-month visit. Most parents, 107 (58%), had less than a high school education, and 170 (90%) reported Latino ethnicity. In the intention-to-treat analysis, no difference between the groups was observed for change in percent distance from the median or BMI z-score. The median number of interactions was 14 (IQR 10-20) over 6 months for those who did engage, though 24 of 118 (20%) had no interaction. Those with no interactions in We Can! had a mean increase in change from median of 6.7 [standard deviation (SD) = 8.2]; those with higher participation experienced a 0.4 (SD = 9.2) change, p = 0.04. Conclusions: Parent mentors were not effective in changing the adiposity indices in this study overall, with some evidence of efficacy after accounting for participation.

"Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Access to care has been identified as a significant factor affecting hypertension treatment and control. We examined disparities in access to care among US adults with self-reported hypertension. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2011 data, we identified US adults with self-reported hypertension. Access to care was assessed based on responses to questions about health insurance, having an identified personal doctor, and cost barriers to visiting a doctor. We assessed access to care by geographic location (ie, US state) and selected sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, 159,947 eligible participants reported having hypertension. Among them, 19.1% had no health insurance, 18.1% had no personal doctor, and 23.6% could not visit a doctor because of cost. Among those with hypertension by state, age-standardized prevalence of no health insurance ranged from 6.3% in Hawaii to 28.1% in Texas. The prevalence of those without a personal doctor ranged from 9.2% in Massachusetts to 32.7% in Nevada, and the prevalence of cost barrier to visiting a doctor ranged from 10.8% in North Dakota to 35.1% in Tennessee. By sociodemographic characteristics, the prevalence with no health insurance was highest among those aged 18-44 years (25.9%), Hispanics (28.1%), those with less than a high school education (32.8%), and those with a household income of less than $25,000 (31.6%). Similar disparity patterns were noted for estimates of the other access-to-care variables. Among US hypertensive adults, approximately 20% reported access-to-care challenges, with significant geographic and sociodemographic variations.","Fang, Jing Yang, Quanhe Ayala, Carma Loustalot, Fleetwood",,"Fang, J Yang, QH Ayala, C Loustalot, F",1377,"[Fang, Jing; Yang, Quanhe; Ayala, Carma; Loustalot, Fleetwood] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Heart Dis & Stroke Prevent, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,,,,,2025-01-19,access to care; blood pressure; disparity; hypertension,10.1093/ajh/hpu061,Article,,1941-7225,jfang@cdc.gov,1386,,,,AT0BF,HEALTH-INSURANCE COVERAGE; UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION; UNITED-STATES; POPULATION; AWARENESS; MORTALITY; RISK,11,AM J HYPERTENS,Am.

"Background Although interventions on child development target supporting mothers' relationships with their children, little is known about maternal knowledge of child development in developing countries. The purpose of this study was to determine maternal knowledge about child development in Turkey. Methods The Caregiver Knowledge of Child Development Inventory (CKCDI) developed for this study consisted of questions on when children begin to demonstrate developmental skills and when caregivers should provide opportunities for developmental stimulation. Results In total, 1200 mothers of children aged <= 3 years chosen by random population-based sampling were administered the CKCDI in their homes. Of the 1055 mothers with complete data (88%), 64% had at most secondary school education and 11% were employed. The median CKCDI questionnaire score was 19 (highest possible score 40). Mothers believed that most developmental skills and activities should occur at later than normative ages and most mothers did not know that sight (52%), vocalization (79%), social smiling (59%) and overall brain development (68%) begins in the early months of life. In a linear regression model with CKCDI score as the dependent and age of child, number of children, maternal and paternal age and education as the independent variables, higher maternal education and lower number of children were found to be independent predictors of higher CKCDI scores (P < 0.001). Conclusions These results illustrate the degree to which caregivers from Turkey may be lacking information on early childhood development and that caregiver knowledge needs to be further investigated so that culture-specific and effective interventions can be planned.","Ertem, I.

"Background: Despite the strong evidence of harmful effects, tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy continue to be major public health challenges. Some women, however, do stop spontaneously when they learn of their pregnancy. No study has investigated spontaneous cessation of both behaviors in a low-income predominantly unmarried U.S. population. Objective: To describe the prevalence of spontaneous cessation of cigarette and alcohol use alone and in combination and associated factors among low-income pregnant women. Methods: Subjects (N=601) were currently smoking or smoking when they became pregnant and participating in Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs in the greater Boston, Massachusetts, area. Baseline inter-views assessed the factors being studied and the spontaneous cessation of cigarette and alcohol use with pregnancy. Saliva cotinine verified self-reported smoking status. Results: Spontaneous cessation of smoking and alcohol use was reported by 28% and 80% of the women, respectively; 25% spontaneously quit both, and 15% stopped neither. Multivariable analyses indicated that smoking cessation was less likely in women who had previous births, had a husband or partner who smoked, were born in the United States, were black (non-Hispanic, non-Portuguese), had less than a high school education, were highly addicted, reported lower perceived risk to the fetus, and reported ""too many other problems in life to stop."" Hispanic ethnicity, younger age, and more social support to quit smoking were related to spontaneous alcohol abstinence. Conclusions: Targeted multiple strategies, including those aimed at increasing participation of partners, are needed for low-income pregnant smokers.","Ockene, JK Ma, YS Zapka, JG Pbert, LA Goins, KV Stoddard, AM",PII S0749-3797(02)00492-0,"Ockene, JK Ma, YS Zapka, JG Pbert, LA Goins, KV Stoddard, AM",150,"Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Div Prevent & Behav Med, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.

"Although numerous factors are associated with attrition in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, many are unmodifiable and therefore difficult to target in efforts to improve treatment outcomes. The current study sought to identify the strongest and most modifiable predictors of attrition in long-term residential SUD treatment from myriad characteristics associated with treatment termination. Archival data were examined for 2,069 adults (74% male; 38% non-Hispanic White) who entered a long-term residential SUD treatment facility between January 2010 and June 2016. Program staff recorded clients' demographic, situational, substance use, and intake data at admission; discharge data were recorded at termination. To increase the likelihood our results were clinically meaningful, we randomly split our sample, ran 2 5-step hierarchical logistic regressions, and cross-validated our results. Across samples, we found younger age, having less than a high school education (Step 1), unstable living arrangements (Step 2), greater prior month use of primary substances, less prior month use of alcohol, and prior year needle use preceding treatment (Step 4), and longer recommended length of stay in treatment (Step 5) predicted attrition. To improve long-term residential SUD treatment completion, we propose treatment adaptations begin with the most modifiable predictors of attrition. Accordingly, the current data indicate initial focus should be placed on refurbishing the process through which recommended treatment durations are approached by providers. Subsequent focus should be placed on modifiable factors that present greater systemic challenges, followed by those that are unmodifiable but can be indirectly targeted by interventions tailored to specific underrepresented groups.","Baker, Danielle E.

"High blood pressure (HBP) is the leading risk factor for years of life lost in Brazil. Factors associated with HBP awareness, treatment and control need to be understood better. Our aim is to estimate prevalence, awareness, and types of anti-hypertensive treatment and to investigate the association of HBP control with social position. Data of 15,103 (54% female) civil servants in six Brazilian state capitals collected at the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) baseline (2008-2010) were used to estimate prevalence and cross-sectional association of HBP control with education, per capita family income and self-reported race, using multiple logistic regression. Blood pressure was measured by the oscillometric method. 35.8% were classified as presenting HBP; 76.8% of these used anti-hypertensive medication. Women were more aware than men (84.8% v. 75.8%) and more often using medication (83.1% v. 70.7%). Adjusted HBP prevalence was, in ascending order, Whites (30.3%), Browns (38.2%) and Blacks (49.3%). The therapeutic schemes most used were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in isolation (12.4%) or combined with diuretics (13.3%). Among those in drug treatment, controlled blood pressure was more likely in the (postgraduate) higher education group than among participants with less than secondary school education (PR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.14-1.28), and among Asian (PR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.12-1.32) and 'Whites (PR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12-1.26) compared to Blacks. Socioeconomic and racial inequality-as measured by different indicators-are strongly associated with HBP control, beyond the expected influence of health services access.","Chor, Dora Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz Pinho Carvalho, Marilia Sa Duncan, Bruce Bartholow Lotufo, Paulo Andrade Nobre, Aline Araujo de Aquino, Estela Mota Lima Leao Schmidt, Maria Ines Griep, Rosane Harter Molina, Maria Del Carmen Bisi Barreto, Sandhi Maria Passos, Valeria Maria de Azeredo Judith, Isabela Bensenor, Martins Matos, Sheila Maria Alvim Mill, Jose Geraldo",e0127382,"Chor, D Ribeiro, ALP Carvalho, MS Duncan, BB Lotufo, PA Nobre, AA de Aquino, EMLL Schmidt, MI Griep, RH Molina, MDCB Barreto, SM Passos, VMDA Judith, I Bensenor, M Matos, SMA Mill, JG",,"[Chor, Dora] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

"Our paper traces the history and progressive development of environmental education and education for sustainable development (ESD) in Sweden and Denmark. Our main focus is on work in primary and lower secondary schools as part of a search for trends of international interest related to the conceptualisation and practice of environmental education and ESD in both countries, as well as the role and significance of democratic perspectives to their development. Traditionally, Sweden has a more centralised approach to change compared to a more decentralised approach in Denmark. Accordingly, the interplay between the State, the individual and private initiatives has differed over the past half-century, and this has given rise to interesting effects on the development of environmental education as well as ESD. The discussion of their development in Sweden draws on historical, political and organisational perspectives, while for Denmark, we focus on how these perspectives relate to a series of challenges; for example, the epistemological challenge of the development of environmental education that resulted in 'the new generation of environmental education', and the effects of taking an action competence approach to environmental education. In both countries the links between the development of environmental education and ESD and the discourse of environmental protection and democracy are highlighted, as are the interplays between the State's agenda on education, the actions of research institutions, and the provision of in-service teacher training. Sweden has become a world leader in initiatives for ESD promotion and joint efforts to spur innovations and clarification of ESD, while Denmark has mainly put its efforts into developing science education, and in this regard, has sacrificed the development of ESD.","Breiting, Soren Wickenberg, Per",,"Breiting, S Wickenberg, P",9,"[Breiting, Soren] Aarhus Univ, Danish Sch Educ, Dept Curriculum Res, DK-2400 Copenhagen NV, Denmark.

"Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (CRP) is an educational framework that illustrates how to foster educational excellence through a focus on cultural competence, critical consciousness, and academic success, which aims to empower students by making education more applicable and responsive to their lived experiences (Ladson-Billings, 1995). This study elucidates the efficacy of CRP within financial literacy education, as implemented in a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) summer enrichment program. Our objective is to explore the extent to which CRP influences student perceptions of their personal finances through an understanding of financial literacy. Employing a qualitative methods approach, we reviewed transcripts, surveys, and student work from program participants, distilling salient themes that underscore the impact of CRP on financial literacy comprehension. Our findings reveal the critical role of CRP methodologies, particularly in tailoring content to resonate with student experiences and recognizing the cultural influences on financial behaviors. Additionally, we examine the challenges and opportunities encountered within a virtual paradigm, a shift necessitated by the exigencies of the pandemic. Despite the limited empirical studies on the nexus between CRP and financial literacy within educational frameworks, this article seeks to bridge this gap. We analyze the perspectives of students participating in the STEAM enrichment program to explore the impact of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (CRP) in a summer financial literacy program. This study takes place within the framework of '$mart Money', a four-session summer program. The focus is to determine whether there is a discernible change in student perceptions about money.","Gibert, Renee Adams, Imani Kang, Sungwoo",2387900,"Gibert, R Adams, I Kang, S",,"[Gibert, Renee] Purdue Univ, Curriculum Studies, W Lafayette, IN USA.

"Rural adolescents are at a greater risk for substance abuse and other mental health challenges. There is a need for enhanced evidence-based prevention efforts. This case study evaluated both remote and in-person instruction of Second Step (R), a social-emotional learning (SEL) curriculum aimed to improve school-based prevention efforts. Second Step (R) was implemented in a rural Midwestern middle school from Fall 2020 to Spring 2022. Pre- and post-surveys were given to 7th grade (n = 233) and 8th grade (n = 146) students. To evaluate program implementation, t-tests were conducted. Post-survey scores were compared to evaluate remote versus in-person learning. Seventh grade students showed significant improvement of self-efficacy in overcoming obstacles, and this was expanded via in-person instruction. Eighth grade students increased knowledge of identifying and disrupting bullying, and the goal-setting unit showed more success taught via remote instruction. Second Step (R) shows promise in increasing self-efficacy and knowledge of SEL topics. Exploratory results suggest both in-person and remote implementation should be considered. Social-emotional learning (SEL) should be a component of middle school education as a measure for risky behavior prevention and mental health promotion. The Second Step (R) program may show promise in increasing confidence and knowledge in skills such as overcoming obstacles, goal setting, identity development, and bullying prevention. Both in-person and remote implementation have potential for improving social-emotional skills of middle school students.","Hunter-Mullis, Kristina Qing, Catherine Decker, Kim Alexander",,"Hunter-Mullis, K Qing, CTRE Decker, KA",4080,"[Hunter-Mullis, Kristina] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Appl Hlth Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.

"Introduction: During climate related displacement, women face additional challenges in safely managing menstrual hygiene. The aim of this study is to evaluate menstrual hygiene management practices among displaced women of reproductive age in the coastal areas of Kerala, India. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among displaced costal women in Kerala. We collected data on their socio-demographic factors, WaSH facilities, and menstrual hygiene practices following displacement, using a pre-tested semi-structured interview questionnaire. The participants also completed the Menstrual Hygiene Practice Needs Scale. We performed both univariate and bivariate analyses. Results: The average age of the participants was 32 years (SD 8.5). Around 59 % had completed some school education, 41 % had completed college education, 30% were employed, and 59 % belonged to lower socioeconomic status. Over half of the participants had poor menstrual hygiene practices (55 %). Older women (OR:1.72, 95% CI:1.08-2.72) and those with lower education (OR:2.22, 95 % CI:1.38-3.56) were more likely to have poor menstrual hygiene practices. Disposal of menstrual materials is problematic. Self-reported physician-diagnosed urinary tract infection (UTI) was 46 %, and reproductive tract infection was 8.4 %. Conclusion: The research highlights the need to improve menstrual hygiene practices and address UTI prevalence through better facilities during sea invasions. Collaboration with local authorities to address related concerns is recommended. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

"Early childhood development (ECD) practitioners from low-resource communities may find it challenging to provide developmentally appropriate services to support child development, due to the increased risk of developmental delays. Practitioners rely on their ECD knowledge when delivering ECD services, but many practitioners in South Africa are underqualified. The knowledge and needs of practitioners from low-resource communities should be explored to develop and implement appropriate support services. A combined Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory (KIDI) and KIDI-Preschool (KIDI-P) tool was used to investigate ECD knowledge, and a questionnaire was utilised to determine participants' needs. The mean score for their ECD knowledge was 47.0%. ECD qualification and experience were not identified as significant contributors for better knowledge scores, but having a high school education (beta = 4.702, t = 3.387, p = 0.001), being a parent (beta = 3.764, t = 2.091, p = 0.038), training completed 5 or more years ago (beta = 4.271, t = 2.142, p = 0.034), and a need for information on developmental milestones (beta = 2.399, t = 1.992, p = 0.048) were. The most commonly reported need was related to training and furthering knowledge. The findings provide insight into the knowledge base of ECD practitioners, their needs as well as significant contributors to better ECD knowledge. Implications for practice can be guided by the Nurturing Care Framework (World Health Organization 2019), since the participants and findings from the study can be contextualised within it. ECD practitioners, especially those from low-resource communities, need adequate support in the crucial role they are playing. Further research should be conducted to determine consistency of the findings.","Smit, Nadia Adele van der Linde, Jeannie Eccles, Renata Swanepoel, De Wet Graham, Marien Alet",,"Smit, NA van der Linde, J Eccles, R Swanepoel, D Graham, MA",197,"[Smit, Nadia Adele; van der Linde, Jeannie; Eccles, Renata; Swanepoel, De Wet] Univ Pretoria, Dept Speech Language Pathol & Audiol, Fac Humanities, Pretoria, South Africa.

"Objective: The study of the pattern and outcome of adoptions in Enugu, Nigeria in order to determine the challenges in the emerging adoption practice in the state. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of adoption practices in Enugu Nigeria based on data from the National women's Commission. The National Women's Commission is the statutory body responsible for the documentation and follow-up of adoption in Enugu State. The characteristics of adopters and adoptees, types of adoption, prevalence and outcome of the adoptions between January 1991 and December 2001 were examined. Percentages were used for descriptive statistics and student's t-test for comparing means at 5% significance levels. Results: There were sixty-one adoptions in the eleven-year period giving a prevalence of 5.5 adoptions per year. Eighteen (29.5%) kinship adoptions and 43 (70.5%) adoptions of abandoned babies and children were recorded. The mean age of the adoptees was 4.2 years and 33.3 % of them were 5 years and above. All adopters were Nigerians but 32.0% of them resided overseas. The commonest age range at adoption was 4-49 years and the peak duration of marriage prior to adoption was 15-19 years. Most adopters (84.9%) had at least secondary school education. No adoption was annulled and there was no recorded death of adoptees. Post care monitoring was found to be incomprehensive. Conclusion: The growing practice of adoption in Enugu is laudable but post adoption care is poor. Emphasis on post adoption care is vital in developing countries where complex social and logistic factors militate against it. In infertility management early institution of counseling on adoption would allow couples ample time for decision making and preparation for adoption, as well as encourage adoption when couples are still young.","Aniebue, P.

"Modeling allows students to become more effective designers. High school technology and engineering students engage in engineering design challenges as part of traditional instructional practices. Model-eliciting activities (MEA) present students with opportunities to elicit mathematical thinking that facilitates modeling. Students (n = 266) from four high schools completed a MEA and design challenge procedure. The research design utilized a quasi-experimental method, post-test only, with homogenous matching comparison groups based on possible confounding variables. A rubric was used to measure student design performance. Students in the comparison group (n = 124) completed a traditional design challenge and were assessed on their design performance. Students in the treatment group (n = 142) completed a MEA, a traditional design challenge and were assessed on their design performance. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used in order to discover if the difference in average design challenge rubric score from comparison group (42.56) to the treatment group (45.18) was statistically significant. A one-way multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to indicate if the differences in student average scores in each rubric category were significant. The ANCOVA did not reveal evidence supporting the research question with regard to overall design performance. The Pillai's Trace MANCOVA test results were significant. Four design rubric categories were found to be significantly different: Criteria, Proposal, Test/Evaluate, and Communicate. The findings in this study suggest that MEAs significantly support design-based classroom activities.

"Students' success in physics problem-solving extends beyond conceptual knowledge of physics, relying significantly on their mathematics skills. Understanding the specific contributions of different mathematics skills to physics problem-solving can offer valuable insights for enhancing physics education. Yet such studies are rare, particularly at the high school level. This study addresses the underexplored area of this topic in secondary education by investigating the associations between physics problem-solving performance using a robust methodological framework. We applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify latent sub-mathmetics skills relevant to physics problem-solving and employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the causal impact of these skills on students' performance in physics. The study analyzed data from a municipal-wide assessment involving 1,878 grade 12 students in Southern China. The results demonstrate that mathematics skills impacting high school students' physics problem-solving performance can be categorized into two sub skills, algebraic skills and geometric skills. It also indicates that algebraic skills have a stronger direct effect on physics problem-solving performance compared to geometric skills in high school setting. These findings suggest that integrating focused algebraic training within physics education can significantly improve student outcomes in STEM fields. We recommend that educators design curricula and instructional strategies that emphasize the development of algebraic skills necessary for solving complex physics problems. Additionally, these findings have important implications for policymakers, who should consider integrating targeted mathematics training within physics curricula to foster interdisciplinary learning and better prepare students for challenges in STEM education.","Tong, Tong Pi, Feipeng Zheng, Siyan Zhong, Yi Lin, Xiaochun Wei, Yajun",,"Tong, T Pi, FP Zheng, SY Zhong, Y Lin, XC Wei, YJ",,"[Tong, Tong; Pi, Feipeng; Zheng, Siyan; Zhong, Yi; Lin, Xiaochun; Wei, Yajun] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Phys & Mat Sci, Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Bldg Adm West 401,230,West Waihuan St, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",Guangzhou University,,,,,2025-01-19,Physics problem-solving; Mathematics skills; Secondary education; Structural equation modeling,10.1007/s11165-024-10201-5,Article; Early Access,OCT 2024,1573-1898,weiyajun@gzhu.edu.cn,,,,,I0X9J,ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; SELF-EFFICACY; RELIABILITY,,RES SCI EDUC,Res.

"Background Bioinformatics is fundamental to biomedical sciences, but its mastery presents a steep learning curve for bench biologists and clinicians. Learning to code while analyzing data is difficult. The curve may be flattened by separating these two aspects and providing intermediate steps for budding bioinformaticians. Single-cell analysis is in great demand from biologists and biomedical scientists, as evidenced by the proliferation of training events, materials, and collaborative global efforts like the Human Cell Atlas. However, iterative analyses lacking reinstantiation, coupled with unstandardized pipelines, have made effective single-cell training a moving target.Findings To address these challenges, we present a Multi-Interface Galaxy Hands-on Training Suite (MIGHTS) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, which offers parallel analytical methods using a graphical interface (buttons) or code. With clear, interoperable materials, MIGHTS facilitates smooth transitions between environments. Bridging the biologist-programmer gap, MIGHTS emphasizes interdisciplinary communication for effective learning at all levels. Real-world data analysis in MIGHTS promotes critical thinking and best practices, while FAIR data principles ensure validation of results. MIGHTS is freely available, hosted on the Galaxy Training Network, and leverages Galaxy interfaces for analyses in both settings. Given the ongoing popularity of Python-based (Scanpy) and R-based (Seurat & Monocle) scRNA-seq analyses, MIGHTS enables analyses using both.Conclusions MIGHTS consists of 11 tutorials, including recordings, slide decks, and interactive visualizations, and a demonstrated track record of sustainability via regular updates and community collaborations. Parallel pathways in MIGHTS enable concurrent training of scientists at any programming level, addressing the heterogeneous needs of novice bioinformaticians.","Goclowski, Camila L.

"Due to the dynamic nature of the agricultural industry, educators and their institutions face difficult challenges as they try to keep pace with future demands for knowledge and skilled workers. On the other hand, computational thinking (CT) has drawn increasing attention in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at present and, as advanced technologies and tools emerge, it is imperative for such innovations to be sustained with knowledge and skill among STEM educators and practitioners. The present case study aims to explore the relation between CT, STEM and agricultural education training (AET) in a Greek vocational training institute (IEK), the Agriculture IEK of Metamorfosis city (IEKMC), which is active in agriculture education. The research methodology is utilized according the positivist philosophical approach through data acquisition employing a questionnaire and the quantitative (statistical) analysis of data collected. The sample consists of IEKMC educators and students selected based on simple random sampling. Based on the participants belief that CT and STEM philosophy add value in the learning process, it focuses on the application of knowledge in the real world (students) and problem solving using new technologies (educators). Educators consider ""experiments"" as the most significant educational tool for problem solving in teaching practice. Students rate Greek Agriculture Education and Training (GAET) higher than educators. However, the participants evaluate GAET very low due to the lack of new innovative teaching methods being introduced. Finally, there is great interest in the implementation of CT and STEM in the European Union (EU) by students and educators.","Chondrogiannis, Eleftherios Symeonaki, Eleni Papachristos, Dimitris Loukatos, Dimitrios Arvanitis, Konstantinos G.",,"Chondrogiannis, E Symeonaki, E Papachristos, D Loukatos, D Arvanitis, KG",230,"[Chondrogiannis, Eleftherios; Symeonaki, Eleni; Loukatos, Dimitrios; Arvanitis, Konstantinos G.] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Iera Odos 75, Athens 11855, Greece.

"Workforce pipelines are essential to sustain a productive workforce in an increasingly competitive, high-tech environment. Advanced automation, sensors, materials and data analytics will increase the need for highly skilled workers in the manufacturing (and manufactured construction) sector. Attracting and developing the next-generation workforce is not without its challenges; however, students are often deficient in technical skills and generally have negative perceptions about manufacturing and construction. As a result, new education and training models have been developed to provide instruction at all levels of the educational system, with a focus on both traditional students and non-traditional students, including ethnic minorities, women, veterans, disabled persons and older adult learners. This study focused specifically on certain underrepresented students in STEM programs offered at community colleges in the Great Plains region of the U.S. An available online training program by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers was used as a contextualized online training tool. The Learning Management System embedded in this online training tool was used to gather student data. Conducting multiple regression analyses on the test outcomes, completion rates, and improvement between post-test and pre-test scores showed that female participants achieved greater improvement between pre- and post-test scores than males, and achieved higher rates of credentialing compared to all other demographic groups. African American participants achieved greatest improvement between pre- and post-test scores than all other ethnic groups while Hispanics achieved higher rates of module completion. Additionally, this study also examines the background related to contextualized teaching and learning, as well as the effectiveness of this delivery method for these underrepresented populations.","Mohammadi, Arefeh Grosskopf, Kevin Killingsworth, John",46,"Mohammadi, A Grosskopf, K Killingsworth, J",,"[Mohammadi, Arefeh] Virginia Tech, Engn Educ Dept, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.

"There has long been a struggle over how to increase student interest in careers in STEM and meet the labour market's need for specialised knowledge and skills. The long-standing debate at the EU level about the role of formal, informal, and non-formal education in meeting these challenges has not yet reached a clear conclusion. In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of STEM programmes offered by various non-governmental organisations in Croatia. These interventions are often localised and have limited social impact, but there is a strong willingness to create an environment for their greater inclusion in the formal education system, triggered by comprehensive curriculum reform in Croatia. Motivation, especially intrinsic motivation, is a crucial driving force in our lives. In our pilot study, conducted with 6th grade elementary students, we aimed to explore the extent to which STEM interventions encourage students to learn more about the topic and whether it is possible to incorporate lessons learned from the pandemic into the design of future interventions. Our results show that there is no significant difference in student motivation after a 45-minute whole-class interactive intervention between face-to-face and virtual delivery. Although the intervention was entertaining, students perceived the science as interesting and useful rather than entertaining. Considering that students have positive attitudes toward Nature as a school subject, an early intervention with students at this age could be useful in maintaining their interest and preventing a decline in interest later in life. This finding is particularly important in the context of the transformation of the Croatian elementary school system into a ""whole -day school"", which provides room for incorporating this type of intervention into a regular school system.","Dugandzic, Maja Bozinovic, Ksenija Ceci, Sasa Majhen, Dragomira Nestic, Davor Kosicek, Marko",,"Dugandzic, M Bozinovic, K Ceci, S Majhen, D Nestic, D Kosicek, M",297,"[Dugandzic, Maja] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.

"The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss pedagogical frameworks and approaches to developing, delivering, and evaluating a new interdisciplinary course within the domain of energy informatics at both Master's and PhD levels. This study is needed because many papers on sustainable energy engineering education concentrate on course content but provide very little information on the pedagogical methods employed to deliver that content. The proposed new course is called ""smart energy and power systems modelling"" and is aimed at discussing how mathematical optimization, in the context of computer science, can contribute to more effectively managing smart energy and power systems. Different pedagogical frameworks are discussed and adapted for the specific domain of energy informatics. An ASSURE model coupled with Bloom's taxonomy is presented for the design of the course and identification of learning objectives; self-regulated learning strategies are discussed to enhance the learning process; a novel model called GPD (Gaussian Progression of Difficulty) for lecture planning was proposed; a teaching-research nexus is discussed for the course planning and enhancement. Adopting qualitative analyses and an inductive approach, this paper offers a thorough reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of the new course, together with improvement possibilities based on fieldwork and direct experience with the students and colleagues. Opportunities and challenges of interdisciplinary teaching are presented in light of real-world experience, with a particular focus on the interaction between mathematics and computer science to study the specific application of energy and power systems.","Bordin, Chiara Mishra, Sambeet Benth, Fred Espen",5757,"Bordin, C Mishra, S Benth, FE",,"[Bordin, Chiara] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Comp Sci, Postboks Langnes 6050, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.

"Background and Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate STEM teachers' digital literacy and technological integration skills. The willingness of teachers to implement new teaching methods is one of the most important determinants of educational success. Engagement, confidence, curiosity, and comprehension of integrated STEM disciplines will increase as a result of indirect STEM integration teaching experiences. Therefore, it is essential to conduct research on STEM teachers' digital literacy knowledge since it is believed that STEM education, which focuses primarily on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, involves complex science and engineering practices.Methodology: 150 teachers in STEM subjects from Kuala Terengganu were randomly selected to participate in the study using a simple and stratified random selection method. The data was collected using a questionnaire with five sections: respondent information, comprehension of digital tools, communication and collaboration, creation of digital content, security, problem-solving, and technology integration. Correlation and linear regression were used to analyse the data.Findings: Based on the findings, the level of digital literacy knowledge after COVID-19 was moderately high. In addition, there is a correlation between STEM teachers' digital literacy knowledge and their technology integration. It is estimated that STEM teachers' knowledge of digital literacy influenced approximately 47% to technology integration.Contributions: This study's findings may be beneficial for identifying the digital literacy challenges teachers in STEM fields confront post-Covid-19. Future research can therefore emphasize the identification and development of effective educational materials and programmes for STEM teachers, as well as the integration of technology into teaching and learning, in order to further develop the digital literacy of STEM teachers.","Ramli, Fatin Nadirah Aqilah Arsad, Nurazidawati Mohamad",,"Ramli, FNA Arsad, NM",316,"[Ramli, Fatin Nadirah Aqilah; Arsad, Nurazidawati Mohamad] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Educ, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM teacher; digital literacy; knowledge; technology integration; Covid-19,10.24200/jonus.vol8iss2pp316-333,Article,,0127-9386,azidarsad@ukm.edu.my,333,,,,N0SY1,AGGRESSION; COMPETENCE; KNOWLEDGE,2,J NUSANT STUD-JONUS,J.

"Engaging students in scientific practices has become an important pedagogical component in STEM education, although its implementation in laboratories is still emerging. This paper uses three types of guiding questions to facilitate scientific practices in introductory and analytical chemistry laboratories. What makes our instructional model different from other developments is that certain types of scientific practices can be promoted by incorporating guiding questions into traditional laboratories, namely, type I prelaboratory questions for experimental design and implementation, type II postlaboratory guiding questions for knowledge construction, and type III postlaboratory guiding questions for experimental error analysis. Answers to these guiding questions were assessed for students' correct chemical knowledge and procedure design (type I) and for their presentation of the three key components of an argument: evidence, justifications, and claims (types II and III). A significant improvement in student score on types II and III questions and a modest upgrading on type I questions were observed as students progressed through Introductory Chemistry Laboratories to Analytical Chemistry Lab. Type I prelaboratory guiding questions incorporate a higher level of inquiry than types II and III postlaboratory guiding questions, thus more practices are needed to master advanced skills. Student performance on guiding questions improved throughout the semester in analytical chemistry laboratories. Students rated their experiences and helpfulness of guiding questions positively. This instructional model can be adopted in other science laboratories for setting up explicit goals and prioritizing useful information without changing the structure of curricula.","Gao, Ruomei Lloyd, Judith Emenike, Bright U.

"Introduction: In 2016, the United States transitioned to two new braille codes for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Little is known about the experiences of teachers of students with visual impairments in learning and supporting their students in learning these new braille codes: Nemeth Code within Unified English Braille (UEB) Contexts and UEB Technical. Methods: Thirteen certified teachers of students with visual impairments participated in one of three focus groups during the spring of 2020. The audio files were transcribed and then analyzed. Results: Some participants reported that they were still in the process of transitioning to Nemeth Code within UEB Contexts or UEB Technical. The majority of participants learned a new code through self-study and were introducing the symbols incrementally to their students. The participants reported that their students had been successful in learning Nemeth Code within UEB Contexts or UEB Technical, but there were challenges, including inadequate lead time, in supporting their students in STEM classes. Discussion: Affordable training and professional development for learning a new code were needed. Additional resources, including grade-level charts and curricula for K-12 students, should be created for both codes. Implications for Practitioners: Teachers of students with visual impairments are an essential part of the STEM educational team for students who read braille. Supporting student learning requires specialized knowledge of the braille codes used in STEM courses and technologies for producing tactile materials.

"STEM education for deaf students aims to engage and include intellectual and experiential learning other than normal classrooms. These programs improve students' critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and complex decision-making, which are essential for academic and life success. This study aims to explore several aspects of a STEM based workshop including problem solving skills, STEM skills, subject knowledge, and effectiveness of the workshop for a group of 27 deaf students. The workshop spanned five consecutive days and focused on problem-solving principles within the context of global warming. Moreover, in this study, the Creative Problem-solving approach developed by Osborn and Parnes was implemented to measure improvement of the constructs above, through a post questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's Omega coefficient exceeded .7 for each construct. The data obtained from the questionnaire demonstrated a random distribution of data according to the Shapiro-Wilk test performed (p < 0.05), leading to the use of non-parametric analysis tools. The results based on the non-parametric test analysis (Kruskal Wallis test) show that high school students' problem-solving abilities improved despite the data's randomness (Mean rank = 16.72). The workshop was enhanced for the Preparatory students, who tended to gain more STEM skills and problem-solving abilities from it (Mean rank = 14.75). It also improved the knowledge and STEM skills of Primary-stage students (Mean rank = 18.13 and 18.06, respectively). This study contributes to the existing body of literature by examining how addressing challenges of global warming can enhance various abilities among deaf students.","Anwar, Ruba Elbashir, Abubaker M.

"This paper presents a competition-based active learning approach that prepares undergraduate students for careers in the drone industry. The competition-based learning (CBL) approach focuses on preparing students for three key drone industry requirements (1) drone assembly, testing, and validation using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts, (2) simulation of drone flight missions and (3) manual and semi-autonomous drone piloting. The CBL curricular modules were developed using the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework of cognitive engagement. These modules immersed students in the technical challenges corresponding to the three essential drone industry requirements. The approach was implemented through fourteen (14) drone workshops that culminated in a final drone piloting competition at a STEM research university in the United States. Ninety-seven (97) students from various backgrounds with little to no prior experience in building drones participated in the competition as part of 22 teams in total. Multiple assessment methods were used to evaluate the students' progress and the perceived drone-related skills gained by the end of the workshops. Assessment methods included data from direct formative (weekly or biweekly curricular milestones), direct summative (drone piloting for multiple flight tests), indirect quantitative (Likert-style feedback survey about student perceptions), and indirect qualitative (descriptive feedback comments) tools. Direct quantitative assessments indicated that most students successfully reached the technical milestones of the workshop sessions and gained practical drone piloting skills. The indirect quantitative assessment revealed that students perceived the workshops to be a valuable experience in their drone industry skills and knowledge. Indirect qualitative analysis of the feedback comments revealed that students perceived CBL as an engaging and effective method of introducing drone technology.","Abichandani, Pramod Lobo, Deepan Dimitrijevic, Branislav Borgaonkar, Ashish Sodhi, Jaskirat Kabrawala, Smit Brateris, Daniel Kam, Moshe",,"Abichandani, P Lobo, D Dimitrijevic, B Borgaonkar, A Sodhi, J Kabrawala, S Brateris, D Kam, M",1795,"[Abichandani, Pramod; Lobo, Deepan; Dimitrijevic, Branislav; Borgaonkar, Ashish; Sodhi, Jaskirat; Kabrawala, Smit; Brateris, Daniel; Kam, Moshe] New Jersey Inst Technol, Newark Coll Engn NCE, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",New Jersey Institute of Technology,,,,,2025-01-19,Competition-based learning (CBL); small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAV); drone competition; STEM education; active learning; engineering education,10.1080/10494820.2022.2128821,Article,OCT 2022,1744-5191,pva23@njit.edu,1813,,,,C3N6W,ROBOTICS,5,INTERACT LEARN ENVIR,Interact.

"Education is a significant factor which contributes to overcoming social, economic, health, ecological and other challenges. During a pandemic, formal education adapts to ongoing circumstances, and the learning-teaching process transitions to distance education. A study of the advantages and disadvantages of the realization of certain modalities of distance education is significant as it contributes to the improvement of its quality. The aim was to determine how the citizens of Serbia evaluated the quality of distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research questions focused on how they evaluated: distance education based on modality (via Radio Television of Serbia, Google Classroom, Google Meet, Zoom, Viber groups, WhatsApp), the level of involvement of the learners/students during distance learning classes, the quality and extent of their acquired knowledge, and the level of skills that teachers need to effectively teach in distance education. The study presents the results of a survey carried out in 2020 on a sample of 602 adult Serbian citizens. The results confirm the initial hypothesis that certain modalities of distance education received a highly positive evaluation (Google Classroom, Google Meet, Zoom), and that teachers, learners/students, and other citizens provided statistically significant different evaluations of their quality (classes for primary and secondary school students broadcast on the Radio Television of Serbia; classes via Viber groups, on WhatsApp). Citizens feel that distance education enables efficient learning-teaching during the pandemic, confirming the importance of modern technologies for the learning-teaching process in Serbia, and the need for their continued intense development and application in education.","Krstic, Suzana V.

"Using a design-based orientation, this mixed-method study explored ways to support computing science and engineering students whose study strategies may be inadequate to meet coursework expectations. Learning support workshops, paired with university courses, have been found to assist students as they transition to university learning, thereby contributing to lower attrition rates. Unfortunately, at-risk students are less likely to attend paired learning support initiatives. To broaden participation, incentives can be provided to all students. However, doing so entails that learning support workshops provide students, in general, with relevant insights on learning. Our first research question involved determining the kind of learning support deemed valuable within the discipline by juxtaposing students' perceptions of their coursework challenges, study strategies, motivation, and attitudes with instructors' expectations for student learning. Aligned with a design-based orientation, our second research question explored those aspects of learning that the design of our learning support workshop should address. One hundred fifty-four students responded to an online questionnaire and five instructors were interviewed. Our findings provided us with insights on disciplinary learning, which are to be supported by our workshop design. Specifically, the meta-inference themes of give it a real try; disciplinary craft; and learn from/with others reflect aspects of learning that computing science and engineering students are encouraged to develop. We recommend future research into instructors' disciplinary learning beliefs and how paired learning support can be designed to initiate first-year students into those aspects of learning valued by their respective disciplinary fields.","Guloy, Sheryl Salimi, Farimah Cukierman, Diana Thompson, Donna McGee",,"Guloy, S Salimi, F Cukierman, D Thompson, DM",479,"[Guloy, Sheryl; Salimi, Farimah] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Educ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.

"Recently, educators have worked to improve STEM education at all levels, but challenges remain. Capitalizing on the appeal of robotics is one strategy proposed to increase STEM interest. The interdisciplinary nature of robots, which involve motors, sensors, and programs, make robotics a useful STEM pedagogical tool. There is also a significant need for industrial certification programs in robotics. Robots are increasingly used across industry sectors to improve production throughputs while maintaining product quality. The benefits of robotics, however depend on workers with up-to-date knowledge and skills to maintain and use existing robots, enhance future technologies, and educate users. It is critical that education efforts respond to the demand for robotics specialists by offering courses and professional certification in robotics and automation. This NSF sponsored project introduces a new approach for Industrial Robotics in electrical engineering technology (EET) programs at Michigan Tech and Bay de Noc Community College. The curriculum and software developed by this collaboration of two- and four-year institutions match industry needs and provide a replicable model for programs around the US. The project also addresses the need for certified robotic training centers (CRTCs) and provides curriculum and training opportunities for students from other institutions, industry representatives, and displaced workers. Resources developed via this project were extensively disseminated through a variety of means, including workshops, conferences, and publications. In this article, authors provide final report on project outcomes, including various curriculum models and industry certification development, final stage of the ""RobotRun"" robotic simulation software, benefits of professional development opportunities for the faculty members from the other institutions, training workshops for K-12 teachers, and robotic one-day camps for high school students.","Sergeyev, Aleksandr Kinney, Mark Kuhl, Scott Alaraje, Nasser Highum, Mark Mehandiratta, Prince",,"Sergeyev, A Kinney, M Kuhl, S Alaraje, N Highum, M Mehandiratta, P",8,"[Sergeyev, Aleksandr] Michigan Technol Univ, Elect Engn Technol Program, Houghton, MI USA.

"Bioinspiration is a promising lens for biology instruction as it allows the instructor to focus on current issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. From social distancing to oxygen stress, organisms have been tackling pandemic-related problems for millions of years. What can we learn from such diverse adaptations in our own applications? This review uses a seminar course on the COVID-19 crisis to illustrate bioinspiration as an approach to teaching biology content. At the start of the class, students mind-mapped the entire problem; this range of subproblems was used to structure the biology content throughout the entire class. Students came to individual classes with a brainstormed list of biological systems that could serve as inspiration for a particular problem (e.g., absorptive leaves in response to the problem of toilet paper shortages). After exploration of relevant biology content, discussion returned to the focal problem. Students dug deeper into the literature in a group project on mask design and biological systems relevant to filtration and transparency. This class structure was an engaging way for students to learn principles from ecology, evolution, behavior, and physiology. Challenges with this course design revolved around the interdisciplinary and creative nature of the structure; for instance, the knowledge of the participants was often stretched by engineering details. While the present class was focused on the COVID-19 crisis, a course structured through a bioinspired approach can be applied to other focal problems, or subject areas, giving instructors a powerful method to deliver interdisciplinary content in an integrated and inquiry-driven way.","Snell-Rood, Emilie C.

"Experiences in immersive 3D virtual reality (VR) are more presence-inducing, and so it may be tempting to claim that content will be learned better in VR. This randomized control trial study on natural selection challenges that assumption. This study answers the question of whether learning STEM in an immersive 3D VR environment is always superior to learning via a 2D monitor (PC). This is a 2 x 2 x 3 design. The first factor is platform immersivity (low = 2D PC, or high = 3D VR), the second factor is level of embodiment (lower = watching playback video, or higher = using mouse/controller to agentically manipulate content), and the third factor is test time (pretest, posttest, and follow-up). There was a significant main effect for embodiment, the high embodied and agentic groups learned the most. There was not a main effect for platform, because the participants in the low embodied VR group performed significantly worse than the three other groups. Although, the one high embodied, VR group learned and retained the most knowledge. A path-analysis revealed that the effect of platform was significantly mediated by presence, agency, and engagement. The smaller learning gain in the low embodied VR condition suggests that participants come to the immersive VR experience with expectations about agency and control of the virtual content, and when those expectations were not met, the disconnect was deleterious for learning. More agentic and interactive control of manipulable virtual content is encouraged. Design is critical, and platform is not destiny.","Johnson-Glenberg, Mina C.

"Understanding teachers' attitudes and perceptions of STEM teaching is a key pathway to enhance effective STEM teaching. Inarguably, teachers are the cornerstone of educational quality and play a central role in students' academic performance. Specifically, the pedagogical strategies teachers employ and their effective use in the classroom are strong determinants of students' enrollment or retention in STEM fields of study and eventual careers. This study sought to explore the experiences of high school STEM teachers in Qatar, focusing on the pedagogical approaches they utilize and the challenges they encounter, with the aim of delving into how these approaches and barriers affect the teaching of STEM in the country's high schools. The study's design is observational, with data collected using a survey of 299 secondary high school STEM teachers (11th and 12th grades). To attain the goal of this study, we examined the barriers perceived to impede engagement in effective STEM teaching from high school teachers' perspective. The study's findings pointed to the influence of student- and school-related factors in shaping STEM teaching. Significant differences were detected based on teachers' gender, grade level of teaching, age group, and university education. Logistic regressions revealed that teachers' demographic attributes, including age group and university education, affect their likelihood to use STEM pedagogies in class. This likelihood was significantly affected by student-related barriers and the learning resources/materials employed in classrooms. These findings postulate critical evidence in directing the development of successful STEM learning practices within Qatar's high schools.","Sellami, Abdellatif Ammar, Mohammad Ahmad, Zubair",15192,"Sellami, A Ammar, M Ahmad, Z",,"[Sellami, Abdellatif] Qatar Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Res Ctr, Doha 2713, Qatar.

"Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are poised to revolutionize education by offering immersive and interactive learning experiences. This research comprehensively evaluates the educational applications of AR and VR, specifically emphasizing their impact on student motivation, learning outcomes, engagement, and overall learning experiences. The analysis explores how AR and VR can improve student learning, knowledge retention, and skill acquisition by systematically reviewing existing the literature from diverse educational domains, including K-12 education, higher education, STEM education, professional training, and lifelong learning. Additionally, the research investigates the pivotal role of AR and VR in fostering immersive and interactive learning environments, unveiling how these technologies promote active learning, collaboration, and critical thinking through simulations and interactive experiences. The evaluation considers the potential of AR and VR beyond traditional classroom settings in distance education and assesses the feasibility of virtual classrooms, web-based learning environments, and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). A significant aspect of the study involves understanding student attitudes toward AR and VR technologies and their influence on intrinsic motivation, interest, and enthusiasm for the learning material.

"This paper presents a middle school human-centered robotics (HCR) learning experience and the ways in which it supported students' orientation to technical and social aspects of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The interdisciplinary project associated with this analysis aims to engage diverse students in authentic STEM practices by creating robotic technologies that can assist people in their school, and connect with remote peers. The goal of this project is to increase student interest in and knowledge of STEM topics, and to help students recognize STEM as relevant to their daily lives and broader societal issues. The human-centered focus of the curriculum encouraged thinking from multiple perspectives (e.g. design, social science, programming) and allowed for diverse STEM exploration. We present samples from student work and classroom interactions. These samples show challenges and successes in engaging students with STEM as a combination of social and technical questions and skills. We trace the trajectory of one group's work to highlight moments in which students navigated an engineering design cycle, analyzed and designed social environments, and crossed disciplinary domains through HCR design-using a phenomena, mechanisms, components framework (PMC) to explore systems thinking. Phenomena refers to attention to the function of the robotic technology in the classroom environment. Components included a focus on single parts of the robot, while mechanism addressed how parts of the robot worked together. This qualitative case study demonstrates the capacity social robotics and inquiry-based learning experiences hold for broadening notions of STEM as a social and multidisciplinary learning domain.","Gomoll, Andrea Sabanovic, Selma Tolar, Erin Hmelo-Silver, Cindy E.

"The unprecedented global movement of school education to find technological and intelligent solutions to keep the learning ecosystem working was not enough to recover the impacts of Covid-19, not only due to learning-related challenges but also due to the rise of negative emotions, such as frustration, anxiety, boredom, risk of burnout and the so-called ""Covid fatigue"". Although this is not a new problem, it was deepened during the pandemic, and we need to face old and new challenges in different ways. Despite focusing only on the learning system's inefficiencies and on the hegemony of solutions to tackle the learning gap, we also need to shed light on the strengths and the positive aspects of the learning process to promote wellbeing. As highlighted by John Self, an intelligent tutoring system would behave as if it genuinely cared about the student's success. This note from John Self sheds light on the importance and reflection of what success means and for whom. This study presents a roadmap for positive psychology and artificial intelligence in education. It is intended to identify and understand how the intersection of Positive Psychology and Artificial Intelligence in Education can support the promotion of learning and wellbeing of students, teachers, and other educational stakeholders. As such, a bibliometric analysis of positive psychology and artificial intelligence in education was made as the so-called Positive Artificial Intelligence in Education (P-AIED). The search string was performed in 2021, and the total number of studies gathered was 10,777. After all the PRISMA steps, 256 studies were approved according to the inclusion criteria. The main conclusions were the high number of institutions and researchers with related publications indicate a new trend for the community of AIED; the high number of collaboration from different countries indicates a possible global movement toward P-AIED; Positive Emotion and Engagement were the main Positive Psychology constructs identified in the studies; the lack of well-grounded theories of Positive Psychology indicates an excellent research opportunity; Positive Learning Analytics (P-LA), Positive Educational Data Mining (P-EDM) and Positive Intelligent Tutoring Systems (P-ITS) are three hot topics for P-AIED.","Bittencourt, Ig Ibert Chalco, Geiser Santos, Jario Fernandes, Sheyla Silva, Jesana Batista, Naricla Hutz, Claudio Isotani, Seiji",,"Bittencourt, II Chalco, G Santos, J Fernandes, S Silva, J Batista, N Hutz, C Isotani, S",,"[Bittencourt, Ig Ibert; Chalco, Geiser; Santos, Jario; Silva, Jesana; Batista, Naricla] Univ Fed Alagoas, Comp Inst, Ctr Excellence Social Technol, Maceio, Brazil.

"Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields have historically been disciplines dominated by white men. The colonial ideology designated Africans as subhuman, inferior intellectually, socially, and culturally to the white masculine norm in STEM disciplines. STEM education and careers were thus constructed to attract white, heterosexual, middle-to-upper class, Christian, able-bodied men. This positioning ensured that STEM environments remained inhospitable to anyone whose identity was outside the constructed somatic norm. The calls and imperatives to transform notwithstanding, the transformation process in STEM disciplines is moving at a snail-like pace. This article argues that what is occurring in STEM disciplines in South African universities is reform not transformation. It is underpinned by the intersectional theory within the qualitative paradigm. Seventy-three African doctoral and postdoctoral women students in STEM were interviewed from five South African universities. The findings highlighted how African women in STEM face challenges based on their racial and gendered identities and that what is presented as transformation is still oppressive to them. The study also found that equity through access to education in democratic South Africa does not equate to transformation. The argument presented is that despite existing policies and initiatives in South African universities to transform, the demographic inclusion of African, female staff and students does not necessarily equate to transforming the STEM environment. What needs to occur is a shift beyond reform and towards transformation through the use of strategic inventions which dismantle the racist, sexist, classist, and xenophobic ideology that permeates these environments.","Mkhize, Zamambo",,"Mkhize, Z",637,"[Mkhize, Zamambo] Univ Cape Town, Room 4-6 Harry Oppenheimer Bldg,Upper Campus, ZA-7001 Cape Town, South Africa.",University of Cape Town,,,,,2025-01-19,Transformation; Reform; STEM; Intersectionality; Higher education,10.1007/s10734-022-00918-5,Article,SEP 2022,1573-174X,Zamambo.mkhize@uct.ac.za,659,,National Research Foundation (NRF),National Research Foundation (NRF).,P9MB4,HIGHER-EDUCATION; GENDER; INTERSECTIONALITY; MATHEMATICS,3,HIGH EDUC,High.

"BackgroundThe benefit of home blood pressure monitoring during pregnancy and in low-resource settings is incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences, barriers, and facilitators of home blood pressure monitoring among pregnant women in Ghana.MethodsThis concurrent triangulation mixed-methods study was conducted at an urban tertiary hospital in Ghana. Participants were recruited from adult pregnant women presenting for routine antenatal care. Upon enrollment, participants' demographics and history were collected. At the next study visit, participants received audiovisual and hands-on training on using an automatic blood pressure monitor; they then monitored and logged their blood pressure daily at home for 2-4 weeks. At the final study visit, verbally administered surveys and semi-structured interviews assessed participant's experiences. Quantitative data were analyzed using R version 4.2.2, and frequencies and descriptive statistics were calculated. Qualitative data were imported into DeDoose 9.0.78 for thematic analysis.ResultsOf 235 enrolled participants, 194 completed surveys; of those, 33 completed in-depth interviews. Participants' mean age was 31.6 (SD 5.3) years, 32.1% had not previously given birth, and 31.1% had less than a senior high school education. On a 4-point Likert scale, the majority reported they ""definitely"" were able to remember (n = 134, 69.1%), could find the time (n = 124, 63.9%), had the energy (n = 157, 80.9%), could use the blood pressure monitor without problems (n = 155, 79.9%), and had family approval (n = 182, 96.3%) while engaging in home blood pressure monitoring. 95.88% (n = 186) believed that pregnant women in Ghana should monitor their blood pressure at home. Qualitative thematic analysis demonstrated that most participants liked home blood pressure monitoring because of increased knowledge of their health during pregnancy. While most participants found measuring their blood pressure at home doable, many faced challenges. Participants' experiences with five key factors influenced how easy or difficult their experience was: 1) Time, stress, and daily responsibilities; 2) Perceived importance of BP in pregnancy; 3) Role of family; 4) Capability of performing monitoring; 5) Convenience of monitoring.ConclusionsAmong pregnant women in urban Ghana, home blood pressure monitoring was perceived as positive, important, and doable; however, challenges must be addressed.","Newman, Noah Beyuo, Titus K.

"ImportanceCharacterizing the extent and pattern of unmet needs for treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) could help target efforts to improve access to ADHD medications and outpatient mental health care. ObjectiveTo describe current ADHD medication use and lifetime outpatient mental health care among a large national sample of children with ADHD. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis study uses cross-sectional survey data from the first wave of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study (n=11723), conducted from June 1, 2016, to October 15, 2018, among 1206 school children aged 9 and 10 years who met parent-reported Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for current ADHD. Statistical analysis was performed from March 23, 2022, to March 10, 2023. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCurrent ADHD medications including stimulants and nonstimulants, lifetime outpatient mental health care, or either treatment. Weighted results are reported. ResultsAmong a sample of 11723 children, 1206 had parent-reported ADHD (aged 9-10 years; 826 boys [68.2%]; 759 White, non-Hispanic children [62.2%]), 149 (12.9%) were currently receiving ADHD medications. Children receiving ADHD medications included a significantly higher percentage of boys (15.7% [121 of 826]) than girls (7.0% [28 of 108]), White children (14.8% [104 of 759]) than Black children (9.4% [22 of 206]), children of parents without a high school education (32.2% [9 of 36]) than of parents with a bachelor's degree or higher (11.5% [84 of 715]), and children with the combined subtype of ADHD (17.0% [83 of 505]) than with the inattentive subtype (9.5% [49 of 523]). Approximately 26.2% of children (301 of 1206) with parent-reported ADHD had ever received outpatient mental health care. Children receiving outpatient mental health care included a significantly higher percentage of children whose parents had a high school education (36.2% [29 of 90]) or some college (31.0% [109 of 364]) than a bachelor's degree or higher (21.3% [153 of 715]), children with family incomes of less than $25000 (36.5% [66 of 176]) or $25000 to $49999 (27.7% [47 of 174]) than $75000 or more (20.1% [125 of 599]), and children with the combined subtype of ADHD (33.6% [166 of 505]) than with the predominantly inattentive subtype (20.0% [101 of 523]) or the hyperactive-impulsive subtype (22.4% [34 of 178]) of ADHD. Conclusions and RelevanceThis cross-sectional study of children with parent-reported ADHD suggests that most were not receiving ADHD medications and had never received outpatient mental health care. Gaps in treatment, which were not directly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, underscore the challenges of improving communication and access to outpatient mental health care for children with ADHD. This cross-sectional study uses data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study to describe current attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication use and lifetime outpatient mental health care among a large national sample of children with ADHD.","Olfson, Mark Wall, Melanie M.

"BackgroundSTEM education providers increasingly use complex intervention models to redress persistent under-representation in STEM sectors. These intervention models require robust evaluation to determine their effectiveness. The study examines a complex, sustained intervention intended to build science capital in young people aged 11-15 over 3 years, which drew on science capital theory and related research to inform intervention design and evaluation. When evaluation results differed from those anticipated, process evaluation supported authors to interpret these findings. By outlining challenges faced in the evaluation of a complex, sustained STEM outreach intervention, this paper addresses critique that outreach programmes focus too often on short-term and positive findings.ResultsIntervention outcomes were assessed using a quantitative questionnaire adapted from science capital research, issued to pupils at the intervention's baseline (2015), midpoint (2017) and endpoint (2019). Adopting a cohort-based model, the 2015 questionnaire collected a baseline for the Year 7 intervention group (children aged 11-12, N = 464), and established baseline comparator groups for Year 9 (children aged 13-14, N = 556) and Year 11 (children aged 15-16, N = 342). The Year 7 intervention group was re-evaluated again in 2017 when in Year 9 (N = 556), and in 2019 when in Year 11 (N = 349). Analysis explored differences in science capital between the intervention and comparator groups and identified lower composite science capital scores and greater proportions of low- and medium-science capital in the intervention group when compared with the two comparator groups. A rationale for this emerged from the subsequent process evaluation.ConclusionsThis study's main contribution is the provision of nuanced insight into the evaluation of STEM interventions for use by others evaluating in similar circumstances, particularly those adopting sustained or complex delivery models. This paper concludes that assessing the effectiveness of complex interventions cannot rely on quantitative evaluation of outcomes alone. Process evaluation can complement quantitative instruments and aid interventions to better understand variability and interpret results. While this study highlights the value of science capital when designing intervention models, it also illustrates the inherent challenges of using an outcome measure of 'building science capital', and quantifying levels over an intervention's course.","Padwick, Annie Dele-Ajayi, Opeyemi Davenport, Carol Strachan, Rebecca",33,"Padwick, A Dele-Ajayi, O Davenport, C Strachan, R",,"[Padwick, Annie; Dele-Ajayi, Opeyemi; Davenport, Carol; Strachan, Rebecca] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle City Campus Ellison Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, England.",Northumbria University,,,,,2025-01-19,STEM education; Science capital; Complex intervention; Evaluation research; Implementation theory; Process evaluation,10.1186/s40594-023-00421-y,Article,,,annie.padwick@northumbria.ac.uk,,,,,G3WE5,WOMEN; INTERVENTIONS; EDUCATION; IDENTITY,1,INT J STEM EDUC,Int.

"Religious-spiritual (R/S) education helps medical students cope with caregiving stress and gain skills in interpersonal empathy needed for clinical care. Such R/S education has been introduced into K-12 and college curricula in some developed nations and has been found to positively impact student's mental health. Such a move has not yet been seen in the Indian education system. This paper aimed to examine perspectives of teachers and parents in India on appropriateness, benefits, and challenges of including R/S education into the school curriculum and also to gather their impressions on how a R/S curriculum might promote students' health. A cross-sectional study of religiously stratified sample of teachers and parents was initiated in three preselected schools in India and the required sample size (N = 300) was reached through snowballing technique. A semi-structured questionnaire, with questions crafted from ""Religion and Spirituality in Medicine, Physicians Perspective"" (RSMPP) and ""American Academy of Religion's (AAR) Guidelines for Religious Literacy,"" was used to determine participants' perspectives. Findings revealed that teachers' and parents' ""comfort in integrating R/S into school curriculum"" was associated with their gender (OR 1.68), education status (OR 1.05), and intrinsic religiosity (OR 1.05). Intrinsic religiosity was significantly (p = 0.025) high among parents while ""intrinsic spirituality"" was high (p = 0.020) among teachers. How participants' R/S characteristics influence their support of R/S education in school is discussed. In conclusion, participants believe R/S education will fosters students' emotional health and interpersonal skills needed for social leadership. A curriculum that incorporates R/S education, which is based on AAR guidelines and clinically validated interpersonal spiritual care tools would be acceptable to both teachers and parents.","Ramakrishnan, Parameshwaran Baccari, Andrew Ramachandran, Uma Ahmed, Syed Faiz Koenig, Harold G.",,"Ramakrishnan, P Baccari, A Ramachandran, U Ahmed, SF Koenig, HG",,"[Ramakrishnan, Parameshwaran] AdiBhat Fdn, New Delhi, India.

"Transition-aged foster care youth have higher risks of adverse outcomes, notably in education and employment, than youth who do not spend time in foster care. For the purpose of assisting a successful transition of foster care youth to adulthood, states provide Independent Living Services (ILS) with federal funding support. This study aims to test ILS's effects on educational attainment and employment of foster care youth. We employ multi-state data sources: the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) Outcome survey, NYTD service files, and the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, collected from foster youth (N = 4206). The dependent variables are high school completion, post-secondary education, and full-time employment measured at age 21. The independent variable is any ILS use in the following areas during the ages of 17-18: academic support, career preparation, employment or vocational training, mentoring, or education financial assistance. Propensity Score Matching was used to adjust for potential selection bias and pre-existing differences in observation data between youth who received and did not receive ILS. The weighted logistic regression analyses show that foster youth using ILS are significantly more likely to complete high school education (Odds Ratio = 1.25, p = .03), have a post-secondary education (Odds Ratio = 1.20, p = .03), and work full-time (Odds Ratio = 1.24, p = .04) in emerging adulthood. We discuss the gaps and challenges in current research that estimates ILS effects. The findings suggest that it is critical to fully implement these services, explore approaches for providing more complete and equitable access, and continue work that further explicates key factors in receipt and effectiveness of ILS for transition-aged youth.","Kim, Youngmi Ju, Eunsu Rosenberg, Rachel Farmer, Elizabeth (Betsy) M.

"Background: HIV prevention efforts have given limited attention to the relational schemas and scripts of adult heterosexual women. These broader schemas and scripts of romantic and other sexual liaisons, partner selection, relationship dynamics, and power negotiations may help to better understand facilitators and barriers to HIV risk-reduction practices. Methods: We conducted exploratory qualitative interviews with 60 HIV-uninfected heterosexual African-American women from rural counties in North Carolina and Alabama, and Hispanic women from an urban county in southern Florida. Data were collected for relationship expectations; relationship experiences, and relationship power and decision-making. Interview transcripts underwent computer-assisted thematic analysis. Results: Participants had a median age of 34 years (range 18-59), 34% were married or living as married, 39% earned an annual income of $12,000 or less, 12% held less than a high school education, and 54% were employed. Among the Hispanic women, 95% were foreign born. We identified two overarching relationship themes: contradictions between relationship expectations and desires and life circumstances that negated such ideals, and relationship challenges. Within the contradictions theme, we discovered six subthemes: a good man is hard to find; sex can be currency used to secure desired outcomes; compromises and allowances for cheating, irresponsible, and disrespectful behavior; redefining dating; sex just happens; needing relationship validation. The challenges theme centered on two subthemes: uncertainties and miscommunication, and relationship power negotiation. Gender differences in relationship intentions and desires as well as communication styles, the importance of emotional and financial support, and the potential for relationships to provide disappointment were present in all subthemes. In examining HIV risk perceptions, participants largely held that risk for HIV-infection and the need to take precautions were problems of women who differed from them (i.e., abuse drugs, are promiscuous, exchange sex). Conclusion: Underlying women's relational schemas was a belief that relationship priorities differed for men and women. Consequently, expectations and allowances for partner infidelity and negligent behaviors were incorporated into their scripts. Moreover, scripts endorsed women's use of sex as currency in relationship formation and endurance, and did not emphasize HIV risk. Both couple-and gender-specific group-level interventions are needed to deconstruct (breakdown) and reconstruct (rewrite) relationship scripts.","McLellan-Lemal, Eleanor Toledo, Lauren O'Daniels, Christine Villar-Loubet, Olga Simpson, Cathy Adimora, Ada A.

"IMPORTANCE Few population-based studies in the US collected individual-level data from families during the COVID-19 pandemic.OBJECTIVE To examine differences in COVID-19 pandemic-related experiences in a large sociodemographically diverse sample of children and caregivers.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) multi-cohort consortium is an ongoing study that brings together 64 individual cohorts with participants (24757 children and 31700 caregivers in this study) in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico. Participants who completed the ECHO COVID-19 survey between April 2020 and March 2022 were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Data were analyzed from July 2021 to September 2022.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Exposures of interest were caregiver education level, child life stage (infant, preschool, middle childhood, and adolescent), and urban or rural (population <50 000) residence. Dependent variables included COVID-19 infection status and testing; disruptions to school, child care, and health care; financial hardships; and remote work. Outcomes were examined separately in logistic regression models mutually adjusted for exposures of interest and race, ethnicity, US Census division, sex, and survey administration date. RESULTS Analyses included 14 646 children (mean [SD] age, 7.1 [4.4] years; 7120 [49%] female) and 13 644 caregivers (mean [SD] age, 37.6 [7.2] years; 13 381 [98%] female). Caregivers were racially (3% Asian; 16% Black; 12% multiple race; 63% White) and ethnically (19% Hispanic) diverse and comparable with the US population. Less than high school education (vs master's degree or more) was associated with more challenges accessing COVID-19 tests (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.88; 95% CI, 1.06-1.58), lower odds of working remotely (aOR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.03-0.07), and more food access concerns (aOR, 4.14; 95% CI, 3.20-5.36). Compared with other age groups, young children (age 1 to 5 years) were least likely to receive support from schools during school closures, and their caregivers were most likely to have challenges arranging childcare and concerns about work impacts. Rural caregivers were less likely to rank health concerns (aOR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69-0.86) and social distancing (aOR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.91) as top stressors compared with urban caregivers.CONCLUSIONS Findings in this cohort study of US families highlighted pandemic-related burdens faced by families with lower socioeconomic status and young children. Populations more vulnerable to public health crises should be prioritized in recovery efforts and future planning.","LeWinn, Kaja Z. Trasande, Leonardo Law, Andrew Blackwell, Courtney K.

"Background: In recent years, the use of restorative justice (RJ) and restorative practices (RP) in schools has grown rapidly. Understanding how theory and research address this topic is important for its practical implementation based on scientific knowledge. The aim of this article was to analyse the practices derived from RJ implemented in school and what kinds of results have been achieved. Starting from the analysis of the qualitative and quantitative research in the field, a systematic review was conducted on the last decade of studies using RJ and RP at every level of school education. Methods: For this review, methods including the PRISMA guidelines, the PRISMA flow diagram, and qualitative synthesis were carried out. Scientific articles for the literature review were selected according to the following criteria: (1) publication date between the years 2010-2021; (2) student population aged 6-18 years; (3) publications in the English language; (4) articles directly accessible or accessible by contacting the author(s); 34 articles met the inclusion criteria. Results: The most used RP in school are circles (n = 26), followed by restorative conferences (n = 17), peer mediation (n = 10), restorative conversations (n = 8), mediation (n = 7), community-building circles (n = 5). RP can improve the school climate, discipline, positive conflict management through actions that aim at preventing suspensions, exclusions, conflicts, and misbehaviours (e.g., bullying). RJ practices promote positive relationships between peers and between students and teachers, as well as to prosocial behaviours through the development of social and emotional skills. Conclusions: From the studies examined, a great interest in applying restorative justice and practices in schools clearly emerged. Discussions on the benefits and challenges of implementation were provided. However, there is still limited evidence in terms of direct correlation, which suggests further studies on the impact of RJ and RP in school settings.","Lodi, Ernesto Perrella, Lucrezia Lepri, Gian Luigi Scarpa, Maria Luisa Patrizi, Patrizia",96,"Lodi, E Perrella, L Lepri, GL Scarpa, ML Patrizi, P",,"[Lodi, Ernesto; Perrella, Lucrezia; Lepri, Gian Luigi; Scarpa, Maria Luisa; Patrizi, Patrizia] Univ Sassari, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",University of Sassari,,,,,2025-01-19,school; restorative justice; restorative practices; children; adolescents; literature review,10.3390/ijerph19010096,Review,,1660-4601,elodi@uniss.it; lucrezia.perrella@outlook.it; gllepri@uniss.it; mlscarpa@icloud.com; patrizi@uniss.it,,,"University of Sassari (FAR-Fondo di Ateneo per la ricerca, 2020/University Research Fund, 2020)","This research was funded by the University of Sassari (FAR--Fondo di Ateneo per la ricerca, 2020/University Research Fund, 2020).

"The English language is a catalyst for economic growth, modernization, and globalization. In this milieu, English language competency-defined as the practical ability to use English effectively in diverse contexts, encompassing linguistic, cognitive, and intercultural skills-is recognized as an essential skill (Amor et al., 2023). Research on English language competency among ethnic minority students is sparse, obscuring the dynamics between personal and environmental factors. We analyzed factors influencing language competency, examining the interplay across the theory's five system levels using 82 research papers published from 2014 to 2024. The three factors most commonly discussed were at the individual level (psychological factors), the microsystem level (teachers and family), and the macrosystem level (language policies, sociocultural influences, and identity). Our analysis also revealed the importance of conducting thorough studies at various levels. These include the microsystem level, which involves examining the interactions between teachers, families, and students and the challenges faced in practical cooperation between parents, educators, and students. Additionally, the mesosystem level, which focuses on digital learning tools, the exosystem level, which considers factors such as socioeconomic status and mass media, and the chronosystem level, referring to discrete shifts like switching from a monolingual to a multilingual environment, are also crucial areas of study. The study ends with research directions highlighting the necessity for a holistic examination of the factors influencing EFL learning among ethnic minorities, and the need for future research to include broader and more diverse samples for a comprehensive cross-cultural analysis. As the world grows more interconnected, English competency becomes a gateway to global participation and economic advancement. However, for ethnic minority students, especially in remote areas, achieving language competency is a multifaceted journey shaped by a myriad of factors. Our systematic review, spanning a decade of research, sheds light on how psychological attributes, family support, educational tools, and societal influences converge to affect English learning. We emphasize the need for a holistic approach that considers the complex interplay of personal motivation, digital learning environments, and cultural identity. This study not only identifies the challenges faced by these students but also charts a path for future research to enhance our understanding and support of their linguistic journey.

"Due to the strong impact of soil salination on the productivity of crops, the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) such as phytodesalination is intended to reverse its effects. While this practice is used in most Middle Eastern countries, Mexico has just begun envisaging its benefits and potential. This study evaluated factors promoting the adoption of phytodesalination among agricultural producers based on the municipality of Villamar, Mexico. Two hundred forty-five semistructured surveys were designed and applied to farmers who participated in various events to disseminate the practice of phytodesalination. Information was gathered on the socioeconomic/demographic characteristics and affectation levels of their parcels due to the effects of salinity. Through a logistic regression using Lasso restriction, the factors influencing the farmers' decisions to adopt phytodesalination in their specific productive models were evaluated. The results show that more than 87% of the surveyed farmers are male, that their average age is 52 years, that more than 82% have at most an elementary or high school education, that the average plot size in the study area is roughly 4 ha, that more than 76% of the farmers are native to the area and that approximately of 84% use their production exclusively for sales. According to the model employed [prediction of 90% and AUC (area under the curve) of 0.97], the surveyed farmers are mostly influenced by institutional (advice on implementing desalination), organizational (skills and competencies to spread halophyte species in accordance with parcel length and access to halophyte plants) and economic (time to implement phytodesalination) factors. The promotion of this approach and commitment of the region's various institutions are recommended so that farmers can extend their knowledge of SAPs through a comprehensive strategic approach that allows them to address their specific challenges.","Lastiri-Hernandez, Marcos A. alvarez-Bernal, D.

"ContextGiven that the staffing of rural facilities represents an international challenge, the support, training and development of students of rural origin at institutions of higher learning (IHLs) should be an integral dimension of health care provisioning. International studies have shown these students to be more likely than students of urban origin to return to work in rural areas. However, the crisis in formal school education in some countries, such as South Africa, means that rural students with the capacity to pursue careers in health care are least likely to access the necessary training at an IHL. In addition to challenges of access, throughput is relatively low at IHLs and is determined by a range of learning experiences. Insight into the storied educational experiences of health care professionals (HCPs) of rural origin has the potential to inform the training and development of rural-origin students. MethodsSix HCPs of rural origin were purposively selected. Using a narrative inquiry approach, data were generated from long interviews and a range of arts-based methods to create and reconstruct the storied narratives of the six participants. Codes, categories and themes were developed from the reconstructed stories. Reid's four-quadrant model of learning theory was used to focus on the learning experiences of one participant. ResultsAlternative learning spaces were identified, which were made available through particular social spaces outwith formal lecture rooms. These offered opportunities for collaboration and for the reconfiguring of the participants' agency to be, think and act differently. Through the practices enacted in particular learning spaces, relationships of caring, sharing, motivating and mentoring were formed, which contributed to personal, social, academic and professional development and success. ConclusionsLearning spaces outwith the formal lecture theatre are critical to the acquisition of good clinical skills and knowledge in the development of socially accountable HCPs of rural origin.

"While inequality between children and adults characterizes practically every aspect of contemporary society, school is considered a paradigmatic site of adult domination. Childist critiques tend to point to school as a place where adultism is not only conspicuous but also (re)produced. In this article, however, it is argued that the public school, obviously founded by adults for adult purposes, has an important childist dimension. Although it is based on a clear distinction between adult teachers and child students, school can problematize key adultist norms and promote a more age-equal society. This does not imply that exiting schools are necessarily childist, but rather that a certain understanding of the school, which emphasizes its social-democratic significance, can uncover its childist aspects and build on them when reimagining public education. The conception of the school in which the article focuses is presented in Jan Masschelein and Maarten Simons' 2013 book In Defence of the School: A Public Issue. . Although the authors do not refer directly to childism (or child equality), and are clearly writing from an adultist perspective, I argue that the public school they describe does have a childist dimension: it challenges one of the root causes of adultism: considering children the property of their parents. Nevertheless, Masschelein and Simons' conception of the school raises a problem of its own, which also has a childist aspect: the concern that uniform schooling supervised by the state will be detrimental to minority and indigenous groups, imposing a culture and identity determined by adults. The second part of this article addresses this concern, arguing that genuine school education can be key not only to preserving but also to revitalizing minority cultures and identities by allowing the students to bring their ""newness"" into the encounter with the cultures and identities of their families.","Snir, Itay",81824,"Snir, I",,"[Snir, Itay] Max Stern Yezreel Valley Acad Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Dn Emek Yezreel, Israel.",,,,,,2025-01-19,childism; school; minority education; democratic education; equality,10.12957/childphilo.2024.81824,Article,,1984-5987,itays@yvc.ac.il,,,,,E5T9V,COMMON SCHOOL; CHILDHOOD; EDUCATION; RIGHTS,,CHILD PHILOS,Child.

"With over 400 spoken languages, a tribal (indigenous people) population of nearly 100 million, Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Jain and Muslim religions practiced by large sections of populations along with a myriad of other ethnic and cultural identities, flourishing local knowledge systems, social differences based on caste and class so palatable; defining a National system of education of good quality has remained a formidable and elusive challenge in India. Should the content reflect the cultural and social location of the child? Do local knowledge systems related to agriculture, health and medicine, artisanship and folk cultural forms have any place in the formal education system? If so, how should they be balanced with the more 'universal' forms of knowledge? What about language? Should it be mother tongue, Hindi and/or English - how many should be taught to a 10-year old child? Most of these questions apply to other postcolonial multicultural locations as well, around the World. Translated to pedagogy, the intense debate is whether the colonial pedagogies, deeply entrenched in indoctrinal forms of behaviourism ought to persist, or need they be replaced? While it is contented by many that a constructivist approach can accommodate the specific cultural roots of the child and aid in assimilating the child's knowledge into a larger knowledge system, critics have also warned of the risk of cultural relativism. For 30 years, between 1972 to 2002, many of these questions and challenges formed the basis of a very large experiment in improving the quality of school education in India, the Hoshangabad Science Education Programme (HSTP), which formed the basis of the latest National Curriculum Framework (NCF) formulated in 2005. The paper will use the empirical work of the HSTP and NCF2005 to address some of the questions raised earlier to indicate possible directions processes of quality education ought to take in multicultural contexts.","Raina, Vinod",,"Raina, V",9,"[Raina, Vinod] Univ Delhi, Delhi 110007, India.",University of Delhi,,"Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA",International Symposium on Education and Cultural Studies,"MAY 22-24, 2008",2025-01-19,Hoshangabad Science Education Programme (HSTP); National Curriculum Framework (NCF); education; multicultural contexts,10.1080/09502386.2011.534578,Article; Proceedings Paper,,1466-4348,,24,,,,737ID,,1,CULT STUD,Cult.

"PurposeThis study aims to describe the m-learning experience of school students and teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores the factors influencing the continuance intention of m-learning.Design/methodology/approachSemistructured interviews of 24 students and 09 teachers of schools in national capital territory (NCT) Delhi, India were conducted over 03 months and transcribed verbatim. A hermeneutic phenomenological design was used to interpret the text and bring out the ""lived experiences"" of m-learning.FindingsThe following 15 themes or factors influencing continuance intention emerged through the hermeneutic circle: (1) actual usage, (2) attitude, (3) context, (4) extrinsic motivation, (5) facilitating conditions, (6) intrinsic motivation, (7) perceived compatibility, (8) perceived content quality, (9) perceived mobile app quality, (10) perceived teaching quality, (11) perceived usefulness, (12) satisfaction, (13) self-efficacy, (14) self-management of learning and (15) social influence.Research limitations/implicationsThe study offers insightful recommendations for school administrators, mobile device developers and app designers. In addition, suggestions for effectively using m-learning during disasters such as COVID-19 have been provided. Several future research directions, including a nuanced understanding of m-assessment and online discussions, are suggested to enhance the literature on m-learning continuance.Originality/valueThe study enriches the literature on m-learning continuance. A qualitative approach has been used to identify relevant factors influencing m-learning continuance intention among secondary and higher secondary level (Grades 9 to 12) school students and teachers in India. In addition, a conceptual framework of the relationships among the factors has been proposed. Further, an analysis of the lived experiences of m-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated several issues and challenges in using m-learning during disasters.","Singh, Yashdeep Suri, P.

"An increasing number of children have complex and continuing health needs. These children have the same right to a full range of education opportunities as other children. This paper reports on the findings from a small qualitative study of the experiences of parents whose children have complex heath needs, related to their experiences of their child's education. Interviews with parents were used to generate data. Parents encounter a number of challenges to their children achieving equal opportunities in relation to education. The factors which influence their opportunities include: staffing issues, funding issues, the attitudes of individuals and organizations, staff confidence in meeting children's needs, clarity over responsibilities and funding. For parents, what seemed most important is not whether their child accesses mainstream education, but whether the school which they attend assists them to achieve their potential. Children who have complex health needs may have to make a greater effort than their peers to achieve educational goals, and may miss considerable school time. This can impact on their leisure time. Accessing pre-school education can be difficult for children who have complex health needs. Inclusion in education should include pre-school provision, and more work in this area would be beneficial. Inclusion in mainstream education is only beneficial if it enables the child to participate fully with their peers. This requires practical and organizational issues to be addressed, services to be well co-ordinated, responsibilities and funding to be clear, and staff to be enabled to be confident in meeting the child's needs. However, it is also vital that individuals and organizations have a positive attitude to children and to inclusion. The additional effort and time which children may have to spend on their school work because of their health needs should also be recognized and supported appropriately.","Hewitt-Taylor, J.",,"Hewitt-Taylor, J",521,"Bournemouth Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Care, Bournemouth BH1 3LT, Dorset, England.",Bournemouth University,,,,,2025-01-19,child disability; children's rights; chronic health condition; complex needs; inclusion,10.1111/j.1365-2214.2009.00965.x,Article,,1365-2214,jhtaylor@bournemouth.ac.uk,526,,,,454PN,YOUNG-PEOPLE; PERCEPTIONS; SCHOOLS,4,CHILD CARE HLTH DEV,Child Care Health Dev.,English,,24,,,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",JUL,6,HOBOKEN,19320644,,J,WILEY,2009,,"Hewitt-Taylor, J (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Care, Royal London House,Christchurch Rd, Bournemouth BH1 3LT, Dorset, England.",Psychology; Pediatrics,,0305-1862,CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT,,,12,Children who have complex health needs: parents' experiences of their child's education,1,12,WOS:000266694800012,35,,"Psychology, Developmental; Pediatrics",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),16
"A cross-sectional survey of 425 male artisanal and small-scale goldminers (ASGM) was conducted to examine the relationship between the occupational activities of the miners and their blood mercury levels while controlling for relevant biosocial and socio-cultural factors. The data was subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. Initial findings showed that 43.29% of the ASGM miners had blood mercury levels above the occupational exposure threshold. Among the occupational factors, ASGM miners who amalgamate gold, burn amalgam, and ASGM miners who smelt gold were 2.260, 1.881, and 2.094 times respectively more likely to have high blood mercury levels as compared to ASGM miners who did not carry out these activities. Also, ASGM miners who suck excess mercury with their mouth (OR = 0.197, p < 0.001) were less likely to have high blood mercury levels. For the biosocial and socio-cultural attributes, high blood mercury levels was less likely among older ASGM miners (OR = 0.507, p < 0.05). Inversely, high blood mercury levels was more likely among ASGM miners who are married (OR = 1.627, p < 0.05), ASGM miners with junior (OR = 2.240, p < 0.001) and senior (OR = 1.575, p < 0.05) high school education, and ASGM miners who have 6-10 years (OR = 3.802, p < 0.001) and above 10 years (OR = 2.591, p < 0.001) work experience. ASGM miners who amalgamate gold, burn amalgam, and smelt gold are exposed to mercury and are at risk of mercury poisoning. This could, however, be minimized with the right capturing devices and personal protective equipment. This notwithstanding, unsafe, and unsustainable occupational practices such as working in mercury contaminated water and sucking excess mercury with the mouth should be discouraged.","Saalidong, Benjamin M.

"The first Mohalla or Community clinic was set up in July 2015 in Delhi, India. Four hundred and eighty such clinics were set up in Delhi, since then. This review was conducted to synthesize evidence on access, utilization, functioning, and performance of Mohalla clinics. A desk review of secondary data from published research papers and reports was conducted initially from February-May 2020 and updated in August 2020. Eleven studies were included in the final analysis. Studies have documented that more than half to two-third of beneficiaries at these clinics were women, elderly, poor, and with school education up to primary level. One-third to two-third of all beneficiaries had come to the government primary care facility for the first time. A majority who attended clinics lived within 10 min of walking distances. There was high rate of satisfaction (around 90%) with overall services, doctor-patient interaction time and the people were willing to return for future health needs. Most beneficiaries received consultations, medicines, and diagnostics at no cost. A few challenges such as dispensing of medicines for shorter duration, lack of awareness about the exact location of the clinics, and services available among target beneficiaries, and the incomplete records maintenance and reporting system at facilities were identified. Mohalla Clinics of Delhi ensured continuity of primary care and laboratory services during COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In summary, Mohalla Clinics have made primary care accessible and affordable to under-served population (thus, addressed inequities) and brought attention of policy makers on strengthening and investing on health services. The external evaluations and assessments on the performance of these clinics, with robust methodology are needed. The services through these clinics should be expanded to deliver comprehensive package of primary healthcare with inclusion of preventive, promotive, community outreach, and other public health services.","Lahariya, Chandrakant",,"Lahariya, C",5872,"[Lahariya, Chandrakant] World Hlth Org WHO, Country Off India, Dept Hlth Syst, New Delhi, India.",World Health Organization,,,,,2025-01-19,Community clinics; COVID-19; Health services; India; Mohalla Clinics; primary health care; universal health coverage,10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1574_20,Review,,2278-7135,c.lahariya@gmail.com,5880,,,,RZ2RC,PADMA AWARDS,12,J FAM MED PRIM CARE,J.

"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of telehealth, which posed unique challenges for the provision of care to older adults who face numerous barriers to accessing and using technology. To improve older adults' online health-related abilities, the UCSF Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (UCSF-GWEP) partnered with Little Brothers Friends of the Elderly-San Francisco (LBFE-SF) to develop a model telehealth training intervention.Methods: LBFE-SF recruited older adults from their members with wi-fi and paired each one with a new device and volunteer trainer to cover seven lessons and four key tasks (emailing providers, video visits, accessing health information, and using patient portals). Older adults completed surveys to self-assess their skill level after training, and their confidence before, immediately after, and 3 months post training. A subset of trainees were also interviewed about their program goals and experiences. UCSF-GWEP conducted statistical analyses of survey data, and coded interview transcripts to identify aspects of the model supportive to learning and success.Results: Of 43 participants, 31 completed training. Their median age was 75; 48% were non-white; 45% had no more than a high school education; and 63% reported yearly income below U.S. $20,000.Three months after completing the program, more than 50% of trainees reported that they needed little or no help performing all four key tasks, and confidence with video visits, online searches, and patient portals showed significant improvement. Additionally, in interviews participants reported improved health, social benefits, and explained that learning was facilitated by self-pacing, repetition, and longitudinal support from volunteer trainers.Conclusions: Older adults with various barriers to learning technology showed online independence and increased confidence with some telehealth tasks after a novel training intervention. Key characteristics of the model included a tablet device, one-on-one longitudinal support from volunteers, comprehensive learning materials, and community-academic partnership.","Neumann, Alicia V.

"Bangladesh continues to face the persistent issue of child malnutrition. This study aims to investigate the influence of parental characteristics on undernutrition among children under the age of five in both urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. This study utilizes data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-18, which includes 7806 children under the age of five and their parents. The effects of parental education and occupation on undernutrition (e.g., stunting, underweight, and wasting) are examined using the binary probit regression technique. Among rural children, 32.6% are stunted, 22.5% are underweight, and 8.1% are wasted. The corresponding figures for urban children are 25.3%, 18.9%, and 8.9%, respectively. In all forms of undernutrition, children living in rural areas face greater challenges than those living in urban areas. The prevalence of stunting and underweight is low among children, irrespective of their rural or urban background, when both parents have the same level of education. The prevalence is also low when fathers are employers or traders and mothers are homemakers, or when highly educated fathers are employers or traders and highly educated mothers are homemakers. In both rural and urban areas, the risk of stunting, underweight and all forms of malnutrition among children decreases as parents' education levels increase. Children whose fathers work in service or business activities are less likely to experience stunting, being underweight, or wasting compared to children whose fathers work in agriculture or other professions in both areas. In urban areas, children born to mothers with lower levels of education are more vulnerable to wasting than children whose mothers have at least secondary education. To reduce child undernutrition nationwide, it is recommended that both parents have at least a secondary school education and that the father has a stable and sufficient income.","Nahar, Mosammat Zamilun Zahangir, Mohammad Salim",e0307257,"Nahar, MZ Zahangir, MS",,"[Nahar, Mosammat Zamilun; Zahangir, Mohammad Salim] Univ Chittagong, Dept Stat, Chattogram 4331, Bangladesh.",University of Chittagong,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1371/journal.pone.0307257,Article,,,salim.zahangir@cu.ac.bd,,,,,E6O1P,MATERNAL EDUCATION; MALNUTRITION; UNDERWEIGHT; PREVALENCE; HEALTH; RISK,8,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,English,,41,gold,,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",AUG 30,16,SAN FRANCISCO,39213314,,J,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,2024,,"Zahangir, MS (corresponding author), Univ Chittagong, Dept Stat, Chattogram 4331, Bangladesh.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,1932-6203,PLOS ONE,,,0,The role of parental education and occupation on undernutrition among children under five in Bangladesh: A rural-urban comparison,2,2,WOS:001304170300019,19,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),0
"Dengue sustained hotspots (SHS) have resulted in a significant public health burden. In our study, we aimed to (1) compare knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) scores between SHS and non-sustained hotspots (NSHS); and (2) identify and describe gaps and factors associated with KAP of dengue prevention among SHS residents residing in Singapore. A cross-sectional study with convenience sampling was conducted using digital survey in randomly selected SHS and NSHS residential areas, consisting of residents aged 21 or older and who had been residing in their existing housing unit in 2019 and 2020. Chi-square test and T-test were used for comparison analysis of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. A total of 466 respondents completed the self-administered, anonymous survey. There were no significant difference in mean scores for Knowledge [SHS(24.66) vs. NSHS(24.37); P: 0.18], Attitudes [SHS(10.38) vs NSHS(10.16); P: 0.08] and Practices [SHS(9.27) vs NSHS(8.80); P: 0.16] sections. Significant SHS-associated factors identified were age group 41-50 years old [95%CI: 1.25-5.03], Malay (95%CI: 0.17-0.98), up to secondary school education (95%CI: 0.07-0.65), private condominium (95%CI: 1.17-3.39), residing in same household unit for 2-5 years (95%CI: 2.44-6.88), respondents who know that mosquito can breed in open container with stagnant water (95%CI: 0.06-0.98), disagree that reducing Aedes mosquitoes is the only way to prevent dengue: (95%CI: 1.19-3.00) and go to clinic/hospital even without severe symptoms: (95%CI: 0.39-0.95). These independent factors associated with dengue sustained hotspots may influence the risk of dengue transmission in residential areas.","Chng, Jeth WeiQuan Parvathi, Tamilsalvan Pang, Junxiong",18426,"Chng, JW Parvathi, T Pang, JX",,"[Chng, Jeth WeiQuan; Pang, Junxiong] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Tahir Fdn Bldg,12 Sci Dr 2,10-01, Singapore 117549, Singapore.

"In Chinese society over the last two decades, modernisation and globalisation, together with the transition to a market economy, have created new imperatives and challenges for the school music curriculum. As a result, the 2011 reform of the Curriculum Standards for Primary Education and Junior Secondary Education marks the first time that the school music curriculum officially included popular songs. In response to this change, this empirical study explores Chinese adolescents' (mainly 12-17 years of age) popular music preferences in their daily lives and to what extent and in what ways they prefer learning about popular music in Beijing's schools. Data were drawn from survey questionnaires completed by 2971 secondary students and from interviews with 14 school leaders and teachers from 12 secondary schools in 2012. The survey findings of this research reveal the extent of Chinese students' preferences for a variety of popular music styles in their daily lives and in school and the consequent need for the teaching profession to improve students' learning in this area. This paper argues that teaching and learning about popular music rely on the interplay between music found inside and outside the school environment and between formal and informal school music activities, together with interactions between schools and students that might be enabled by developments in the school music curriculum. However, when a new wave of campaigns to assimilate popular music into school education is launched, what will remain to be seen is the degree of the Chinese government's zeal as it strives to transform popular music into a tool for its own purposes, whether it be political ideology, an integration of socialist educational ideals or a mediation of liberal education.","Ho, Wai-Chung",,"Ho, WC",267,"Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Mus, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Hong Kong Baptist University,,,,,2025-01-19,music education; popular music; curriculum change; social change; Beijing,10.1080/14613808.2014.910182,Article,,1469-9893,tediwch@hkbu.edu.hk,289,,,,AP8IJ,GLOBALIZATION; TEXTBOOKS; PEDAGOGY; CULTURE; REFORM; YOUTH,3,MUSIC EDUC RES,Music Educ.

"Background: In this era of rapid technical advancement, there are growing debates around the idea of nanotechnology, which are both timely and controversial. Nanotechnology materials are being utilized in our daily lives in many ways, often without consumer knowledge. Due to the explosion of nanotechnology applications, there is a necessity to update school science curricula by integrating nanotechnology-related concepts that are both relevant and meaningful to students. The integration of nanotechnology in school science curricula comes in response to nanoscientific development and our mission as educators to instill and arouse students' curiosity in learning about both what is and what will be more dominantly occupying the marketplace. Purpose: The purpose of this review was to set a baseline for the current work being conducted in moving nanotechnology-based activities into the school science setting. Design and methods: The review was implemented by searching LexisNexis Academic, EBSCOhost, Academic Search Complete, Education Search Complete as well as Google Scholar using search terms of nanotechnology, nanotechnology in schools, nanotechnology activities, history of nanotechnology, implications of nanotechnology, issues of nanotechnology and related combinations with nanotechnology as a consistent keyword. Returned articles were categorized by thematic content with primary and seminal work being given priority for inclusion. Conclusions: Current literature in the area of nanotechnology integration into school science curricula presented seven key categories of discussion: the origins of nanotechnology, challenges for educational implementation, currently available school activities, current consumer product applications, ethical issues, recommendations for educational policy, and implications of nanotechnology. There is limited availability of school-based activities. There are strong proponents for including nanotechnology in school science curricula. However, barriers to that inclusion are both real and perceived and are consistent with barriers reported for including other new science topics in the curricula, such as time, curricular and cognitive overload, and inclusion on assessment.","Ghattas, Nadira I.

"IntroductionDepression is the most common mental disorder among people living with HIV/AIDS and has a negative impact on HIV treatment outcomes. Training lay HIV counselors to identify and manage depression may contribute to improved patient access and adherence to treatment, and reduce stigma and discrimination among lay health workers toward both HIV and depression. The purpose of this study was to assess the current knowledge and attitudes of lay HIV counselors toward managing depression in primary care in Mozambique. MethodsWe conducted a mixed-methods cross-sectional study to assess depression-related knowledge and attitudes among lay HIV counselors in 13 primary healthcare facilities in Mozambique. We used the quantitative Depression Attitude Questionnaire (DAQ) scale, followed by open-ended questions to further explore three key DAQ domains: the nature of depression, treatment preferences, and professional attitudes or reactions. ResultsThe sample included 107 participants (77.6% female, mean age: 32.3 years, sd = 7.4). Most (82.2%) had less than a high/technical school education. Findings suggested that some HIV counselors had knowledge of depression and described it as a cluster of psychological symptoms (e.g., deep sadness, anguish, apathy, isolation, and low self-esteem) sometimes leading to suicidal thoughts, or as a consequence of life stressors such as loss of a loved one, abuse, unemployment or physical illness, including being diagnosed with HIV infection. HIV counselors identified talking to trusted people about their problems, including family and/or counseling with a psychotherapist, as the best way for patients to deal with depression. While acknowledging challenges, counselors found working with patients with depression to be rewarding. ConclusionLay health counselors identified HIV and psychosocial issues as key risk factors for depression. They believed that the treatment approach should focus on social support and psychotherapy.","Mandlate, Flavio Greene, M. Claire Pereira, Luis F. Sweetland, Annika C.

"Background: Waning donor funding and poor country ownership of HIV care programmes are challenges for the sustainability of care for people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Nigeria. Health insurance presents a viable alternative for funding of HIV care services. This study assessed the determinants of willingness to participate in health insurance amongst PLHIV in a tertiary hospital in South-East Nigeria. Methods: Across-sectional survey was conducted amongst 371 PLHIV on treatment at Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Nigeria, using a semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Chi-square test and logistic regression were conducted with SPSS version 20 at 5% level of significance. Results: Respondents were mostly males (51.8%) with a mean age and monthly income of 45.4 +/- 10.3 years and $74.1 +/- 42, respectively. Majority were willing to participate (82.5%) and to finance health insurance (65.2%). The major reasons cited by those unwilling to participate were poor understanding of how the system works and lack of regular source of income. The predictors of willingness to participate were female gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-5.7), being currently unmarried (AOR = 4.3; 95% CI: 2.3-7.8), being self-employed (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2-3.9), having family size >5 (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.7-5.9) and having less than secondary school education (AOR = 4.3; 95% CI: 2.3-7.8). Conclusion: Majority of the respondents surveyed were willing to participate in, and finance health insurance. Willingness to participate was more amongst vulnerable subgroups (females, unmarried, self-employed, poorly educated and those with large family size). We recommend the inclusion of health insurance in the care package of PLHIV.","Alo, Chihurumnanya Nwachi Okedo-Alex, Ijeoma Nkem Akamike, Ifeyinwa Chizoba",,"Alo, CN Okedo-Alex, IN Akamike, IC",196,"[Alo, Chihurumnanya Nwachi; Okedo-Alex, Ijeoma Nkem; Akamike, Ifeyinwa Chizoba] Fed Teaching Hosp, Dept Community Med, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria.",,,,,,2025-01-19,Determinants; health insurance; Nigeria; people living with HIV; willingness to participate,10.4103/npmj.npmj_11_20,Article,,2468-6875,ijeomaninadr@gmail.com,201,,,,MR3XG,TO-PAY; HOUSEHOLDS; SCHEME; CARE; EXPENDITURE; STATE,3,NIGER POSTGRAD MED J,Niger.

"This article explores the past, present, and future of Christian education (CE) in the Church of Christ in Zimbabwe (COCZ) schools under the Dadaya, Mashoko, and Chidamoyo clusters. It highlights the retrospective and prospective aspects of CE within the church by emphasizing the adaptability, collaboration, and utilization of contemporary tools and resources to effectively carry out the mission of CE in Zimbabwean schools. It acknowledges the strong historical foundation of COCZ schools in providing biblical teachings, moral formation, and faith integration. However, it also highlights the challenges faced by the COCZ in maintaining this foundation posed by church politics and oppressive family ministries. This study assesses the patterns, dynamics, and consequences of intentional CE influenced by the COCZ's ethical and moral principles, commonly known as the Restoration Movement principles or the Stone-Campbell theories of ""restoring the church to its first century forms"". It recognizes the impact of COCZ school education on the development of church leaders as well as civil and secular leaders from COCZ-mission school graduates. However, it acknowledges that the historical foundation has been gradually fading in the post-missionary era. Looking ahead, this article emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to CE that addresses all aspects of individuals' well-being in that church. This includes adapting to societal changes, developing CE-conscious leaders, engaging in community outreach, embracing digital tools and resources, and fostering collaborative networks with other CE-conscious church schools and institutions. This article suggests that by embracing these prospects, the COCZ can enhance its commitment to CE and positively impact the lives of its members and the wider community at its mission stations. Using WhatsApp interviews for data collection, it discusses these prospects by focusing on transformative leadership, embracing diversity, effective communication, and addressing power dynamics to facilitate the church's mission and vision in Zimbabwe.","Masengwe, Gift Dube, Bekithemba",1120,"Masengwe, G Dube, B",,"[Masengwe, Gift; Dube, Bekithemba] Univ Free State, Fac Educ, 205 Nelson Mandela Dr, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",University of the Free State,,,,,2025-01-19,Church of Christ; Zimbabwean education; Christian education; mission schools,10.3390/rel14091120,Article,,2077-1444,2023823590@ufs4life.ac.za; dubeb@ufs.ac.za,,,,,S9VH2,,9,RELIGIONS,Religions,English,,75,gold,,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",SEP,13,BASEL,,,J,MDPI,2023,,"Dube, B (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Fac Educ, 205 Nelson Mandela Dr, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",Religion,,,RELIGIONS,,,1,Retrospective and Prospective Approaches to Christian Education in Church of Christ Schools in Zimbabwe,2,2,WOS:001074565100001,14,,Religion,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),1
"New Hampshire (NH) is one of two states that has developed a population-based mammography registry. The purpose of this paper is to describe what we have learned about mammography use in New Hampshire. After collecting data for 20 months, the database contains almost 110,000 mammographic encounters representing 101,679 NH women, who range in age from 18 to 97 with a mean of 56.7 years (SD = 10.91). Education levels are high with 92% having a high school education and 59% with some college. Forty-six percent report their primary insurance is private, 29% report HMO/PPO coverage, and 25% receive federal health care assistance. Risk factors represented in the database include (categories not mutually exclusive) advancing age (60% over age 50), hormone replacement therapy use by menopausal women (40.6%), and a family history of breast cancer (29%). Penetration of mammography relative to the NH population is higher for younger age groups (40-48% for those aged 44-64) than older age groups (34-39% for those aged 65-84). The majority of mammographic encounters are routine screening exams (86%), often interpreted as negative or normal with benign findings (88%). Use of comparison films to interpret either diagnostic or screening mammography occurred in 86% of encounters. We have matched 3,877 breast pathology records to these mammographic encounters. The distribution of pathology outcomes for diagnostic trams was very similar to that for screening exams (approximately 65% benign, 17% invasive breast cancer, and 6% noninvasive breast cancer). Overall we have designed a system that is well accepted by the NH community. Challenges include careful monitoring of data for coding errors. and a limitation of linking variables in mammography and pathology data. Data represented in this registry are a critical resource for research in mammographic screening and breast cancer early detection.","Carney, PA Goodrich, ME O'Mahony, DM Tosteson, AN Eliassen, MS Poplack, SP Birnbaum, S Harwood, BG Burgess, KA Berube, BT Wells, WS Ball, JP Stevens, MM",,"Carney, PA Goodrich, ME O'Mahony, DM Tosteson, AN Eliassen, MS Poplack, SP Birnbaum, S Harwood, BG Burgess, KA Berube, BT Wells, WS Ball, JP Stevens, MM",183,"Dartmouth Med Sch, Norris Cotton Canc Ctr, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA.

"Teachers as implementers of the curriculum have a vital role in delivering (Casey et al., 2009) reflecting teaching approaches in physical education classes. Cooperative learning is a teaching approach that meets the curricular requirements in Germany as well as considers the increasing heterogeneity of students. However, there is limited research about strategies and practices, which teachers use to implement cooperative learning successfully in physical education. To bridge this gap, our study examines teachers' perspectives on implementation strategies and application approaches of cooperative learning lessons. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 German physical education teachers based on the principle of contrasting. The interviews were conducted from October to November 2022 as problem-related interviews, guided by a theory-based semi-structured guideline. We used qualitative content analysis to analyse the interview data. Analysis was expanded to identify different types of practicing cooperative learning in physical education. The findings reveal that teachers address and implement forms of cooperative learning quite heterogeneously. Teachers' implementation strategies were bottom-up, top-down or hybrid. Reactions to difficulties were avoidance, flexibility, implementing rules, training social skills or restructuring. In addition, five different types of cooperative learning practices were determined ('the avoider', 'the quitter', 'the student-centred', 'the theory-led' and 'the flexible one'). While 'the avoider' and 'the quitter' type teachers stopped using cooperative learning, the other types used this teaching approach often in their physical education classes. 'The flexible one' used the hybrid implementation of cooperative learning and reported the lowest difficulties. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of teachers' strategies and practices to depict how cooperative learning processes in physical education are implemented. Findings can be used to further develop concepts for cooperative learning in physical education. At the same time, this may help to better prepare teachers to realise cooperative learning arrangements and to deal successfully with corresponding challenges.","Schulze, Carolin von Huth, Marcus Schlesinger, Torsten",,"Schulze, C von Huth, M Schlesinger, T",,"[Schulze, Carolin; Schlesinger, Torsten] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Tech Univ Chemnitz, Inst Movement Sci & Hlth, Ringgold Stand Inst, Chemnitz, Germany.

"Background As technology moves rapidly forward and our world becomes more interconnected, we are seeing increases in the complexity and challenge associated with scientific problems. More than ever before, scientists will need to be resilient and able to cope with challenges and failures en route to success. However, we still understand relatively little about how these skills manifest in STEM contexts broadly, and how they are developed by STEM undergraduate students. While recent studies have begun to explore this area, no measures exist that are specifically designed to assess coping behaviors in STEM undergraduate contexts at scale. Fortunately, multiple measures of coping do exist and have been previously used in more general contexts. Drawing strongly from items used in the COPE and Brief COPE, we gathered a pool of items anticipated to be good measures of undergraduate students' coping behaviors in STEM. We tested the validity of these items for use with STEM students using exploratory factor analyses, confirmatory factor analyses, and cognitive interviews. In particular, our confirmatory factor analyses and cognitive interviews explored whether the items measured coping for persons excluded due to ethnicity or race (PEERs). Results Our analyses revealed two versions of what we call the STEM-COPE instrument that accurately measure several dimensions of coping for undergraduate STEM students. One version is more fine-grained. We call this the Coping Behaviors version, since it is more specific in its description of coping actions. The other contains some specific scales and two omnibus scales that describe what we call challenge-engaging and challenge-avoiding coping. This version is designated the Coping Styles version. We confirmed that both versions can be used reliably in PEER and non-PEER populations. Conclusions The final products of our work are two versions of the STEM-COPE. Each version measures several dimensions of coping that can be used in individual classrooms or across contexts to assess STEM undergraduate students' coping with challenges or failures. Each version can be used as a whole, or individual scales can be adopted and used for more specific studies. This work also highlights the need to either develop or adapt other existing measures for use with undergraduate STEM students, and more specifically, for use with sub-populations within STEM who have been historically marginalized or minoritized.","Henry, Meredith A.

"The issue of student disengagement in school science continues to pose a threat to lifting the participation rates of students undertaking STEM courses and careers in Australia and other countries globally. In Australia, several science initiatives to reverse the problem have been funded over the last two decades. Many of these initiatives involve partnerships with scientists, science educators and with industries, as is the case in this paper. The research in this paper investigated a recent partnership initiative between secondary science teachers, scientists and an educational technology company to produce science e-modules on adaptive learning platforms, enabling students to engage in personalised, inquiry-based learning and the investigation of real-world problems. One of the objectives of the partnership project was to build theoretical and pedagogical skills in teachers to deliver science by exposing them to new ways of engaging students with new digital tools, for example analytics. Using a mixed methods approach, the research investigated science teachers' pedagogical involvement in the partnership project and their perceptions of the project's impact on their teaching and students' learning. The findings indicate that the teachers believed that new technology could enhance their teaching and students' learning and that while their students were motivated by the online modules, there was still a need for scaffolding for many of the students. The effectiveness of this would depend on the teachers' ability to internalise the new technological and content knowledge resulting from the partnership and realign them with their existing pedagogical framework. The research is significant in identifying elements for successful partnership projects as well as challenges that need to be considered. It is significant in facilitating continuous discourse about new evidence-based pedagogical approaches to science education in engaging students to learn STEM subjects in a twenty-first century digitally connected future that is focused on learning at a personal level.","Ng, Wan Fergusson, Jennifer",,"Ng, W Fergusson, J",219,"[Ng, Wan; Fergusson, Jennifer] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Educ, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",University of Technology Sydney,,,,,2025-01-19,Science partnership project; STEM education; Science e-modules; Secondary science teachers; TPACK,10.1007/s11165-017-9619-1,Article,,1573-1898,Wan.Ng@uts.edu.au; Jennifer.fegursson@uts.edu.au,242,,Australian Government,"This research was supported by the Australian Government funded Australian Mathematics and Science Partnership Program.

"Didactic videos have proven to be particularly beneficial for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education challenges. This is due to their contribution to the reduction of the intrinsic cognitive load, as well as fostering connections among subjects to promote generative processing. This fact, together with the wide presence of STEM dissemination videos on YouTube, creates an opportunity both for teachers to focus on dissemination channels to acquire quality materials, and for content creators to develop specific videos aiming to serve as pedagogical aid. Aligned with such reasoning, this paper intends to evaluate the use and performance of a STEM YouTube channel that already publishes didactic videos categorized by intentionality into dissemination or educational. Using owners' data, the channel has been analyzed, considering a six-year extension period, from 2017 to 2022, and distinguishing between the two categories of contents. This dual intention of the channel allows to evaluate the educational use of dissemination channels, compared to their use for curiosity satisfaction. Through Mann-Whitney U and correlation analyses, the main channels' metrics have been analyzed in terms of awareness (i.e., impressions, views, or subscribers), use (view duration) and interaction (comments, shares, likes or dislikes). Significant differences have been found in the performance of educational and dissemination contents, such as in views (p < 0.001), average view duration (p = 0.044) and likes (p < 0.001). Additionally, video length optimization has been found as a determining parameter influencing video performance, being educational videos more sensitive to this metric than dissemination videos. This study has shown that a STEM YouTube channel of these characteristics can benefit from publishing videos aiming to a pedagogical purpose, increasing its use compared with other STEM dissemination channels only aiming to an entertainment purpose. Additionally, this study supports previous findings that video length optimization is a determinant characteristic for audience retention rate.","Lijo, Ruben Castro, Jose Juan Quevedo, Eduardo",e24856,"Lijo, R Castro, JJ Quevedo, E",,"[Lijo, Ruben] Hitachi Energy, Power Consulting, Madrid 28037, Spain.

"This study proposes incorporating generative artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs) into the Master of Science (M.Sc.) curriculum on digitization in construction. The aim was to help students generate computer code to solve, automate, and streamline practical challenges in advanced construction engineering and management (CEM). To this end, a host of problem-based learning (PBL) individual assignments and collaborative team projects were developed, alongside a combination of flipped classroom models and blended learning lessons, in order to teach effective interactions with LLMs and mitigate concerns, such as bias and hallucination. The effective interaction with LLMs not only facilitated code generation, which would otherwise be complex without additional formal training, but also provided a platform for strengthening basic project management skills, such as departmentalization, work breakdown structuring, modularization, activity delegation, and defining key performance indicators. The effectiveness of this approach was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated within two new modules, Digital Engineering and Construction and Digital Technologies in Field Information Modeling. These modules were offered over three semesters each as part of a new M.Sc. program in Technology and Management in Construction at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. It was observed that 86.4% of students fully completed the PBL projects, while the remaining 13.6% achieved over 50% completion across all six semesters. Furthermore, anonymous student surveys indicated a teaching quality index of 100% in five semesters and 96.4% in one semester. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed strategy can be used to effectively integrate LLMs to support students in code generation for open-ended projects in CEM. Further research was, however, found to be necessary to ensure the sustainable revision and redesign of the problems as LLM capabilities evolve.","Maalek, Reza",3642,"Maalek, R",,"[Maalek, Reza] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Technol & Management Construct TMB, Dept Digital Engn & Construct DEC, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,,,,,2025-01-19,generative adversarial networks; digital technologies in construction; large language models; STEM education; problem-based learning; AI in construction engineering and management education,10.3390/buildings14113642,Article,,2075-5309,reza.maalek@kit.edu,,,KIT Publication Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,The author wishes to acknowledge the support provided by the KIT Publication Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in supplying the APC.

"The professional identity of scientists has historically been cultivated to value research over teaching, which can undermine initiatives that aim to reform science education. Course-Based Research Experiences (CRE) and the inclusive Research and Education Communities (iREC) are two successful and impactful reform efforts that integrate research and teaching. The aim of this study is to explicate the professional identity of instructors who implement a CRE within an established iREC and to explore how this identity contributes to the success of these programs. 97 CRE instructors from the Science Education Alliance (SEA) iREC participated in a 2-year, multi-stage, qualitative research project that involved weekly reflective journaling, autoethnographic description, small group evaluation and writing, and large-scale community checking. The resulting description of professional identity consisted of shared values (inclusivity, student success, community membership, ownership/agency, science, overcoming failure, and persistence), specified roles (mentor, advocate, scientist, educator, motivator, collaborator, community builder, learner, evaluator and project manager) and a stated sense of self (dedicated, resilient, pride in students, multiskilled, valued, community member, responsible and overworked). Analysis of individual reflective diary entries revealed how a professional identity underpinned and facilitated the ways in which faculty addressed challenges that arose and worked toward the success of every student. It is the self-concept of the professional identity of the instructor in the context of the CRE classroom that directed the extended commitment and effort that these instructors evidently put into their work with students, which facilitated student engagement, student persistence, and their collective scientific output. The study concludes that a professional identity of STEM faculty in the context of a CRE and iREC combines being a researcher and educator, and that this integrated identity is central for current initiatives aimed at transforming undergraduate STEM education.","Hanauer, David Alvey, Richard An, Ping Bancroft, Christa Butela, Kristen Coleman, Sean Clase, Kari L.

"In this opinion paper, we review recent literature related to data and modeling driven instruction in hydrology, and present our findings from surveying the hydrology education community in the United States. This paper presents an argument that that data and modeling driven geoscience cybereducation (DMDGC) approaches are essential for teaching the conceptual and applied aspects of hydrology, as a part of the broader effort to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at the university level. The authors have undertaken a series of surveys and a workshop involving university hydrology educators to determine the state of the practice of DMDGC approaches to hydrology. We identify the most common tools and approaches currently utilized, quantify the extent of the adoption of DMDGC approaches in the university hydrology classroom, and explain the community's views on the challenges and barriers preventing DMDGC approaches from wider use. DMDGC approaches are currently emphasized at the graduate level of the curriculum, and only the most basic modeling and visualization tools are in widespread use. The community identifies the greatest barriers to greater adoption as a lack of access to easily adoptable curriculum materials and a lack of time and training to learn constantly changing tools and methods. The community's current consensus is that DMDGC approaches should emphasize conceptual learning, and should be used to complement rather than replace lecture-based pedagogies. Inadequate online material publication and sharing systems, and a lack of incentives for faculty to develop and publish materials via such systems, is also identified as a challenge. Based on these findings, we suggest that a number of steps should be taken by the community to develop the potential of DMDGC in university hydrology education, including formal development and assessment of curriculum materials, integrating lecture-format and DMDGC approaches, incentivizing the publication by faculty of excellent DMDGC curriculum materials, and implementing the publication and dissemination cyberinfrastructure necessary to support the unique DMDGC digital curriculum materials.","Merwade, V.

"Discipline-based education research-a field of research that investigates teaching and learning within STEM disciplines-has emerged over the last few decades to improve the quality of STEM education worldwide. Simple qualitative questions concerning the career backgrounds and motivations of the individuals who conduct this research have yet to be explored. Here, we surveyed and interviewed discipline-based education researchers about their career trajectories and motivations to pursue this field of research. We focused specifically on recruiting biology education research faculty members at colleges and universities. We used the Social Influence Model and Social Cognitive Career Theory to develop and analyze survey and semi-structured interview questions. Findings revealed participant career paths all began with disciplinary undergraduate and graduate-level biology education. We noticed participants began conducting biology education research due to their values and personal interests, while additionally being swayed by contextual factors. Specifically, participants valued biology education research because it allowed them to make a difference in the world and provided them with a community open to change and collaboration. Biology education research allowed them to explore their interests in teaching and evidence-based approaches to education. These values and interests were impacted by contextual factors, including discoveries of opportunities, positive (or negative) experiences with mentorship, exposure to evidence-based teaching literature, considerations of salary and job security, and experiences with gender-based discrimination. Our results underscore the importance of harnessing individual values and interests-especially those centered on evidence-based teaching practices and making a difference in the world-while fostering a positive and supportive academic environment. This research reveals pathways toward discipline-based education research careers. Additionally, this research can inform the development of graduate programs and funding opportunities.","Driessen, Emily P. Steele, Ariel L. Costello, Robin A.

"This study presents an innovative pedagogical approach aimed at enhancing the teaching of robotics within the broader context of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education across diverse academic levels. The integration of mobile robotics kits into a dynamic STEM-focused curriculum offers students an immersive and hands-on learning experience, fostering programming skills, advanced problem-solving, critical thinking, and spatial awareness. The motivation behind this research lies in improving the effectiveness of robotics education by addressing existing gaps in current strategies. It aims to better prepare students for this rapidly evolving field's dynamic challenges and opportunities. To achieve this, detailed protocols were formulated that not only facilitate student learning but also cater to teacher training and involvement. These protocols encompass code documentation and examples, providing tangible representations of the practical outcomes of the course. In addition to the presented curriculum, this paper introduces the developed methodology that strategically leverages 3D-printing technology. The primary focus of this approach is to create captivating add-ons and establish a versatile workspace, actively promoting heightened engagement and facilitating the acquisition of knowledge among students. The research involves the development of tailored laboratory protocols suited to various academic levels, employing a systematic methodology aimed at deepening students' comprehension of STEM concepts. Furthermore, an adaptable infrastructure for laboratory protocols and in-class testing was developed. The efficacy of this teaching/learning methodology is evaluated through student surveys, ensuring its continuous improvement. These protocols are to be integrated into both the robotics courses and teacher-training initiatives. This study aims to contribute to the field by using a dynamic STEM-driven approach based on mobile robotics. It outlines a strategic vision for better-preparing students and educators in the ever-evolving landscape of robotics education demanded by Industry 4.0 technologies.","Antunes, Rodrigo Aguiar, Martim Lima Gaspar, Pedro Dinis",170,"Antunes, R Aguiar, ML Gaspar, PD",,"[Antunes, Rodrigo; Aguiar, Martim Lima; Gaspar, Pedro Dinis] Univ Beira Interior, Dept Electromech Engn, Rua Marques dAvila & Bolama, P-6201001 Covilha, Portugal.

"Digitalization is a keyword in the discourse of educational science, but it is often linked to technological challenges, although digital changes occur throughout society. Therefore, STEM teachers are required to cope with technological changes in the subject, the increasing and diverse education and training technologies, and the ever-changing paths of information and communication of adolescents in their role as members of a changing society and culture. The TPACK-model focuses educators' professional knowledge based on teachers' expertise concerning technological knowledge per se and the pedagogy and content of their subjects. In contrast, knowledge relevant to daily life and social and cultural interaction beyond this is not clearly included in the TPACK-model at present. This article proposes supplementing the TPACK-model with the knowledge components of digital cultural transformations (digitality) and, therefore, extending the TPACK-model to a DPACK-model, where D stands for digitality. Therefore, digital transformation in STEM teaching requires additional professional knowledge considering the transformation of communication, mediatization and society. Through this expansion, the focus should also be directed on the necessity that children and young people in the digitally shaped world must also be able to critically reflect on the processes of change and shape them in an ethically responsible manner. For this reason, teachers require professional knowledge to reflect, analyze, use and shape the digital transformation, which is regularly demanded of them by national and international educational standards. As a foundation of STEM teachers' education and training, an integrated model combining these facets of knowledge and skills is provided for discussion, and, as a result, quickly found its way into the educational policy guidelines and educational science discourses in Germany. In order to integrate the sociocultural consequences of digitalization into TPACK, this paper proposes a new hemisphere, sociocultural knowledge, which extends the existing TPACK components.","Thyssen, Christoph Huwer, Johannes Irion, Thomas Schaal, Steffen",769,"Thyssen, C Huwer, J Irion, T Schaal, S",,"[Thyssen, Christoph] Univ Kaiserslautern Landau RPTU, Dept Biol Educ, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.

"Robotics not only play a significant role in medicine, manufacturing, or aerospace industry, but also in education. According to governmental studies carried out in the United States and Europe, careers related to STEM skills like engineering, are constantly increasing worldwide. Due to this, several countries have been implementing STEM education. Rut, in Colombia this initiative just recently started to take place. Currently, it is possible to find several STEM educational robotic kits on the market such as boost from Lego, Cozmo from Anki, Mbot from Makeblocks and Dash from Make wonder. In this trend, the STEM robotic kit proposed in this document, pretends to be a hardware grounding to implement a whole STEAM program. It intends to encourage children to develop their science, tech, math, and artistic outcomes. Also, the kit offers a differential plus from others because it has two interactive components: an elephant-bot called Eli, a robot easy to assemble inspired in the protection of African elephants; and, an intuitive user interface, called ""Experiencia Chamali"" made up of three modules. The first one consists of assembly the robot, the second one is designed for developing of spatial perception throughout maze challenges, and the last one is made for test the robot's movements live. Two groups of children between 6 and 11 years old tested the robotic platform. During the activity, the groups reinforced STEM skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving as a conclusion of test results. The children divided the assembly of the elephant-hot into several tasks on their initiative to make an agile construction. Also, in the challenge of the labyrinth, they worked collaboratively on the spatial location. Finally, the members of each group worked as a team decorating the physical labyrinth freely and observing the movements of the ""elephant-hot"" in this environment.","Feijoo-Almonacid, Adriana Rodriguez-Garavito, C.

"Art is a common approach for communicating and educating about science, yet it remains unclear the extent to which science art can benefit varied audiences in varied contexts. To examine this gap, we developed an art exhibit based on the findings of two publications in disease ecology. In study 1, we asked visitors with varying formal science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education backgrounds to complete a survey about their interest in science research before and after viewing the exhibit. In study 2, we recruited upper-level ecology undergraduate students to receive one of three treatments: engage with the art exhibit, read the abstracts of the papers, or do neither. Students completed a comprehension quiz immediately after their learning treatment and again 2 weeks later to evaluate retention. Following the exhibit, visitors who did not report a career or major in STEM showed a greater increase in research interest than visitors who did report a career or major in STEM. For the ecology undergraduate students, comprehension quiz scores were higher for students in the abstract group than the art exhibit group, while both groups scored higher than the control group. Retention of information did not significantly differ between the three groups. Overall, these findings suggest that science art exhibits are an effective method for increasing the accessibility of science to broader audiences and that audience identifiers (e.g., level of formal education in STEM) play an important role in audience experience of science communication and science education initiatives. Art is a common approach for communicating and educating about science, yet it remains unclear the extent to which science art can benefit varied audiences in varied contexts. To examine this gap, we developed an art exhibit based on the findings of two publications in disease ecology.","Ricci, Kyra McLauchlin, Benjamin Hua, Jessica",,"Ricci, K McLauchlin, B Hua, J",,"[Ricci, Kyra; Hua, Jessica] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

"In recent years, Integrated STEAM education has been positioned as an appropriate educational approach to face the challenges of today's society. Nevertheless, to implement this approach in the classroom requires trained and productively teachers. From this perspective, the objective of this article, is to analyse the impact of integrated STEAM education on teachers through their perceptions in a group of 31 in-service Chilean teachers teaching both in early childhood and primary education, with the aim to obtain a diagnosis for the future design of training processes in STEAM. To obtain data, the adaptation of an instrument that evaluates teachers' perceptions of integrated STEM education has been validated. Specifically, three dimensions of this instrument have been analysed: familiarity, attitudes, and confidence of teachers about this educational approach. The results show that: (1) Familiarity: only 6% of the participants consider themselves very familiar with the approach; (2) Attitude: 97% of the participants declare themselves to be very willing or moderately willing to learn more about STEAM; (3) Confidence: the data shows, in general, a moderate level of confidence to implement this approach. In relation to the impact of STEAM integrated education in the Chilean teacher's perceptions, it can be noted that despite the familiarity of the participants is very low, the scenario seems encouraging, because they show a very positive attitude towards this approach, together with a moderate confidence to implement it. Even though these early findings are encouraging, they also show that the teacher's formation is fundamental, because its impact in the teachers, reverberates directly in a positive impact on the students. Consequently, it is necessary to promote the professional development of teachers in STEAM through training programs that improve knowledge about the approach and deliver the necessary tools to implement it in the classroom.","Silva-Hormazabal, Marcela Alsina, Angel",842,"Silva-Hormazábal, M Alsina, A",,"[Silva-Hormazabal, Marcela] Univ Austral Chile, Dept Pedag Specialties, Puerto Montt 5400000, Chile.

"Background: Two-year colleges are uniquely positioned to diversify science, technology. engineering; and mathematics (STEM) education. Yet limited existing scholarship sheds light on how 2-year college students view themselves as learners as they experience STEM courses and programs. An in-depth and nuanced understanding of 2-year college STEM students' self-perceptions as learners presents a powerful vehicle for identifying venues of interventions aimed at cultivating and supporting the STEM talent pool toward success through and beyond the 2-year college sector. Purpose of the Study: We address the following research question: How do 2-year college students participating in STEM classes and programs perceive themselves as learners? Our inquiry is aimed at revealing the fundamental structure underlying these students' experiences as their self-perceptions as STEM learners are farmed and transformed. Study Setting and Participants: We collected the data far this study as part of an ongoing longitudinal mixed methods study of students beginning in STEM programs or courses in Fall 2014 at three large 2-year institutions in a Midwestern state. The sample selection of the present qualitative study drew on maximum variation sampling, yielding a final sample size of 31. Research Design: We adapted descriptive phenomenology to answer our research question. In-person interviews were conducted with each participant. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the procedures aligned with the descriptive phenomenological method proposed by Colaizzi. In addition, we adopted analytical techniques from grounded theory in order to effectively organize our process of documenting, describing. and making sense of the data. Findings: Our findings show that self-perceptions as 2-year college STEM learners are deeply intertwined with self-perceptions as mathematics learners, constantly evaluated and reevaluated in relation to others, driven by an internal process of recognizing the rewards and negotiating the challenges of studying STEM, and shaped by an external process of validation. While these themes stand on their own as prominent defining elements of the phenomenon of our interest, they are also inherently interwoven pieces of a cohesive, complex whole. Conclusions: Our study captures how students' self-perceptions as learners are formed and transformed, and illustrates how their prior and current learning experiences, self-perceptions as mathematics learners, background characteristics, and relationships with others interweave to shape and reshape how they view themselves as learners. Future work should further determine what specific measures and venues 2-year colleges can capitalize upon to develop confident and collaborative learners who embrace the rewards and challenges of studying STEM.","Wang, Xueli Sun, Ning Wagner, Brit Nachman, Brett Ranon",040306,"Wang, XL Sun, N Wagner, B Nachman, BR",,"[Wang, Xueli; Sun, Ning; Wagner, Brit; Nachman, Brett Ranon] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy Anal, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,,,,,2025-01-19,,,Article,,1467-9620,,,,National Science Foundation [DUE-1430642],"This study is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DUE-1430642.

"Immigrants comprise approximately 13% of the US population and 33% lack health coverage. Asian Americans are the fastest growing immigrant group; many lack a usual source of care. This study examines factors associated with health insurance among Asian American immigrants living in New York City. Community needs assessments were conducted among Asian American subgroups in New York City from 2013 to 2015; analysis was completed in 2017 and 2018. Descriptive statistics examined factors associated with health insurance status while stratifying by Asian ethnic subgroup; multivariable logistic regression models further assessed these associations (p < 0.05 significance level). Approximately 19% of the study population (n = 1399) was uninsured. Logistic regression models adjusted for all factors. Among East Asians, insurance status was associated with female sex (OR = 2.8, p = 0.005), excellent/very good health status (OR = 3.5, p = 0.014), and seeing a private doctor when sick or injured (OR = 3.2, p = 0.033). Among South Asians, insurance status was associated with high school/some college and college education (OR = 2.6 and 2.9, respectively, p = 0.039 and p = 0.021), having a routine health check in the past year (OR = 6.4, p < 0.001), no diabetes diagnosis (OR = 2.7, p = 0.030), and a tuberculosis diagnosis (OR = 4.7, p = 0.019). Among Southeast Asians, insurance status was associated with less than high school education (p < 0.05), living in the USA > 20 years (OR = 3.7, p = 0.009), having a routine health check in the past year (OR = 5.6, p = 0.025), and seeing a private doctor when sick or injured (OR = 2.6, p = 0.018). Health insurance status was associated with differing factors among each subgroup. Findings may inform strategies to address challenges and barriers of healthcare access to immigrants, making healthcare more accessible to this underserved population.","Tan, Cynthia Wyatt, Laura C.

"The article is devoted to analyzing the ten-year publication activity of Cherkas Global University. The author concludes that the most popular publications of Cherkas Global University are devoted to the regional history of the Russian Empire (first of all, the history of regional education systems). At the same time, from purely historical articles the most demanded are works on the history of the Caucasus and Ukraine. The article concludes that this is due to the genesis of Cherkas Global University, which originally emerged in the Caucasus, in Sochi, and its evolution, during which several Ukrainian scholars became employees of Cherkas Global University. The article relates the activities of Cherkas Global University to the peculiarities of the ""Soviet division of scientific labour"" identified by M. von Hagen: the clear division of Soviet historical science into center and periphery, with the center, which uses most of its resources, dealing with imperial/Soviet history, and regional history being provincialized. It is shown that the work of Cherkas Global University is a form of reaction of regional scholars to such a ""system of division of scientific labour"", which did not lose its relevance with the collapse of the USSR. Cherkas Global University helps historians from the regions, who in Soviet times were the scientific periphery, to demonstrate their research in the international arena. Such an opportunity is available not only to Cherkas Global University staff, but also to other scholars: the journal published by Cherkas Global University ""Bylye Gody"" actively publishes research by authors not only from Ukraine and the Caucasus, but also from Kazakhstan, Siberia, Kalmykia, the Urals, the Don, and so on. The author assumes that such results were achieved due to the focus on international cooperation, networked cooperation, and a move away from dependence on the authorities of a particular state.","Peretyatko, Artyom Yu.",,"Peretyatko, AY",374,"[Peretyatko, Artyom Yu.] Cherkas Global Univ, Washington, DC 20036 USA.

"The continuous expansion of technological innovation and big data technology to various fields has brought great challenges to the reform of high school education. This work intends to improve the teaching effect of classical poetry in high school Chinese teaching, change the traditional teaching method, improve students' subjective initiative and practical ability, and improve the teaching effect of classical poetry under the traditional philosophy. The Outcome-based Education (OBE) teaching philosophy and the personalized recommendation algorithm of teaching resources based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are applied to the teaching of classical poetry in high school. The teaching objectives, teaching process and teaching activity evaluation are designed. The model design is applied to the teaching of the experimental class, and the results of the application of the design model are comprehensively evaluated through comparison. The result shows: (1) Through the evaluation and analysis of teaching strategies, the satisfaction of pre-class preparation strategy, classroom teaching implementation strategy and after-class teaching evaluation strategy design mode is higher than that of traditional teaching mode. In particular, the satisfaction of teaching results in class 1 and class 2 are 95.1 % and 93.3 %, respectively, while that in the control class is only 62.6 %. (2) The teaching implementation process is evaluated. Comparisons are made from the exploration of teaching activities, the interaction between teachers and students in the classroom, and the recommendation of teaching resources. (3) The application effect of the design model is evaluated. The satisfaction degree of the experimental class is higher than that of the control class in terms of learning attitude, learning ability and academic performance. (4) The satisfaction of the design model is higher than other teaching models in terms of student recognition, goal achievement and teaching effect. It aims to innovate the teaching methods of high school poetry appreciation, provide some reference for teaching reform, and provide some ideas for the subsequent application curriculum.","Lin, Xun Sun, Xuemei",,"Lin, X Sun, XM",538,"[Lin, Xun; Sun, Xuemei] Chuzhou Vocat & Tech Coll, Basic Educ Dept, Chuzhou 239000, Anhui, Peoples R China.",,,,,,2025-01-19,personalized recommendation algorithm; OBE teaching philosophy; classical poetry; teaching model; Convolutional Neural Network,10.47750/RAA/11.3.29,Article,,2168-0973,linxun@chuzc.edu.cn,557,,"2022 Education and Teaching Research planning Project of Anhui Vocational and Adult Education Association, Research on classroom teaching quality improvement strategy of higher vocational education based on OBE [AZCJ2022042]; 2020 College-level key project, Research on anomie of fan culture communication and context reconstruction from the perspective of network community [JYZ 2020-17]; 2020 Provincial Key Teaching and Research Project, Research and practice of online teaching quality monitoring model based on ""integration of thinking"" [2020 ZDXSJG095]; 2022 College-level teaching and Research project, Influence of online and offline mixed teaching mode on English reading teaching in higher vocational colleges [(2022jyxm15]; Provincial cultivation, project"" College Chinese""course Ideological and Political Education case [2020TZPY020]; The 2022 Education and Teaching Research planning Project of Anhui Vocational and Adult Education Association, Research on classroom teaching quality improvement strategy of higher vocational education based on OBE [AZCJ2022042]; The 2020 College-level key project, Research on anomie of fan culture communication and context reconstruction from the perspective of network community [JYZ 2020-17]; The 2020 Provincial Key Teaching and Research Project, Research and practice of online teaching quality monitoring model based on ""integration of thinking"" [2020 ZDXSJG095]; The 2022 College-level teaching and Research project, Influence of online and offline mixed teaching mode on English reading teaching in higher vocational colleges [(2022jyxm15]; Provincial cultivation, project"" College Chinese""course Ideological and Political Education case [2020TZPY020]","1. 2022 Education and Teaching Research planning Project of Anhui Vocational and Adult Education Association, Research on classroom teaching quality improvement strategy of higher vocational education based on OBE (AZCJ2022042) . 2. 2020 College-level key project, Research on anomie of fan culture communication and context reconstruction from the perspective of network community (JYZ 2020-17) . 3. 2020 Provincial Key Teaching and Research Project, Research and practice of online teaching quality monitoring model based on ""integration of thinking"" (2020 ZDXSJG095) . 4. 2022 College-level teaching and Research project, Influence of online and offline mixed teaching mode on English reading teaching in higher vocational colleges (2022jyxm15) 5.

"Background: Adolescent girls are nutritionally vulnerable due to their rapid growth and increased nutrient requirements. Nigeria has the sixth-largest population in the world. This study qualitatively explored the food preferences, perceptions of nutritive value and factors underlying food consumption of adolescent girls in rural communities in Nigeria. Methods: The data were collected via the free listing of foods and focus group sessions conducted in the Hausa language with 48 unmarried adolescent girls. The discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated into English, and analyzed using a deductive thematic framework. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 13.0 +/- 2.7, and almost half (48%) had a primary school education. A total of 19 and 23 foods were identified as preferred, and perceived as nourishing, respectively. The top 10 foods present on both free lists overlapped considerably in terms of cognitive salience. The focus group themes included nutrition knowledge, food preferences, autonomy, household food allocation, courtship practices, and agricultural landscapes and economic access. The participants had minimal knowledge of nutrients and food groups, and their preferred foods were limited in diversity. The key factors in food preferences were desirable health effects, sensory attributes, and the contribution of foods to a desirable body image for marriage. Household food choices depended on parents. Thus, a desire for independence was an incentive for early marriage, mostly at 13 to 17 years. Gender inequities in household food distribution (quantity) and animal protein intake were reported. The participants believed that boys need more food for strength to impregnate girls. As part of a courtship practice, the girls received gifts of animal source foods from potential suitors. The food options were limited by financial challenges and low agricultural diversity. Conclusion: To interrupt the cycle of inadequate food consumption and undernutrition in these adolescent girls, policy makers need to promote nutrition education and address the underlying determinants of inequitable access to nutritious foods.","Sosanya, Mercy E.

"Objective: To identify and describe populations at risk for HIV in 3 clinical research centers in Kenya and South Africa. Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Volunteers reporting recent sexual activity, multiple partners, transactional sex, sex with an HIV-positive partner, or, if male, sex with men (MSM; in Kenya only) were enrolled. Sexually active minors were enrolled in South Africa only. Risk behavior, HIV testing, and clinical data were obtained at follow-up visits. Results: From 2005 to 2008, 3023 volunteers were screened, 2113 enrolled, and 1834 contributed data on HIV incidence. MSM had the highest HIV incidence rate of 6.8 cases per 100 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.9 to 9.2] followed by women in Kilifi and Cape Town (2.7 cases per 100 person-years, 95% CI: 1.7 to 4.2). No seroconversions were observed in Nairobi women or men in Nairobi or Cape Town who were not MSM. In 327 MSM, predictors of HIV acquisition included report of genital ulcer (Hazard Ratio: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.7 to 11.6), not completing secondary school education (HR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.6 to 7.2) and reporting receptive anal intercourse (HR: 8.2, 95% CI: 2.7 to 25.0). Paying for sex was inversely associated with HIV infection (HR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.8). 279 (13.0%) volunteers did not return after the first visit; subsequent attrition rates ranged from 10.4 to 21.8 volunteers per 100 person-years across clinical research centers. Conclusions: Finding, enrolling, and retaining risk populations for HIV prevention trials is challenging in Africa. African MSM are not frequently engaged for research, have high HIV incidence, need urgent risk reduction counseling, and may represent a suitable population for future HIV prevention trials.","Price, Matthew A.

"Youth unemployment in Uganda increased from 12.7% in 2012/13 to 13.3 in 2016/17, despite a decline in the overall national unemployment rate from 11.1% to 9.2%. This poses serious development challenges, particularly to the ongoing efforts to poverty reduction. The main objective of the current study is to examine the extent to which gender, education, residence, and age determine youth unemployment in Uganda. Using recent data from the Uganda National Household Survey 2016/17 collected by the Uganda National Bureau of Statistics, we obtained a sample of 5,912 respondents for the ages between 18 years and 30 years. The main findings based on a binary logistic regression approach, reveal that education, gender, residence, and age are all critical in driving youth unemployment. The Ugandan youth who has some level of education is more likely to be unemployed compared to those with no education. But the youth that attended post-secondary education is associated with the highest unemployment probability followed by those with secondary school education and finally by primary education. While an increase in age appears to increase youth unemployment for females, the married youth have less chances of being unemployed compared to the unmarried youth. Moreover, as the probability of being unemployed reduces for the married youth, being divorced increases that probability. Similarly, the male youth are found more likely to be unemployed than their female counterparts. Additionally, the urban youth increased their chances of unemployment compared to the rural ones. Likewise, males are far more likely to remain in unemployment relative to females, just as living in the northern, eastern, or western region as a youth is less risky in terms of unemployment compared to living in the central region. On the other hand, whereas the education level of the household head is not important for youth unemployment, the marital status and gender of the household head are critical. The indirect effects of education, gender, residence, and age are clearly notable. Implications for policy and research are drawn.","Egessa, Abel Nnyanzi, John Bosco Muwanga, James",08,"Egessa, A Nnyanzi, JB Muwanga, J",,"[Egessa, Abel; Muwanga, James] Makerere Univ, Sch Econ, Kampala, Uganda.

"Despite advances in discussions about the nature of science, there is still a paucity of discussion on the ontological dimension of science in science education research that makes it difficult to defend its content and teaching. In this article, the reasons for trusting science and science education are analyzed through three arguments. The first is that both the belligerent obscurantism and fake news of the ultra-right and the postmodern relativism of sections of the leftwing are connected to objective movements from the capitalist socioeconomic reality. The reestablishment of trust in science and its teaching requires an effort to understand the contemporary social contradictions, problems, and challenges. The second argument is that scientific knowledge does not need to abdicate objectivity in order to ground ethical and political positions. The third argument is that the socialization of scientific knowledge through school education is a necessary, albeit insufficient, condition for the ethical-political education of younger generations. The article concludes by stating that it is necessary to overcome the choice between an education that is supposedly neutral in political and ideological terms and an education that rejects the socialization of scientific knowledge in the name of respecting the multiplicity of culturally rooted voices from within the different oppressed groups present in today's society. Indeed, it is precisely because the findings of science are a constant threat to the spontaneous consciousness of everyday life sanctified by the authority of culture, that doing and teaching science had a subversive quality in my social milieu. It is the contra-conventional character of science that made it an ally of those of us engaged in an internal critique of some of the inegalitarian elements of our culture. The findings of modern ""Western"" science enabled us to show-with empirical evidence that was publicly testable-that no matter what the consensus of local community is, no matter what the powers that be claim, some social values and some facts of nature that these values are informed by, are wrong and must be rejected as false.

"Globally farmers are challenged by increasing climate variability and frequency of extreme events. However, traditional farming enterprises demonstrate resilience. To understand the underlying reasons, traditional farming enterprises in Sri Lanka were explored. Eighty-live farming enterprises were sampled across nine locations of the Intermediate agroecological zone using mixed methods. Farming enterprises incorporate On- and Off-farm livelihood components (graphical abstract). On-farm refers to landholdings with land uses including tree-dominant forest gardens (FGs), paddy, cash crops, swidden plots (che no), plantations and livestock. Off-farm includes employment, trading and grants. We investigated how farming enterprises remained resilient, and which land use had the greatest adaptive capacity and best fulfilled household needs? Farming enterprises were assessed with respect to water availability, farmers' perspectives of climate variability, their socioeconomic characteristics, and land uses in landholdings. Land uses were characterised and compared by floristic diversity, crop: utility benefits, food functions, and those consumed and sold. Results revealed that most respondents were women, had primary school education and engaged full-time in farming. Cultivation was mainly rainfed. Farmers' perceptions of climate variability were supported by meteorological data showing that interannual and seasonal rainfall variability prevailed in the reference and preceding years. Farmers withstood these challenges owing to FGs, which were the oldest and dominant of all land uses, with larger area, highest plant and crop species richness, and crop diversity. Greater numbers of primary and secondary FG crops and products provided multiple household benefits. High floristic diversity, tree-dominance and multifunctionality gave FGs strong adaptive capacity. Nevertheless, farmers adopted multiple land uses with diverse landscape designs and Off-farm livelihood strategies simultaneously because this combination offered greater opportunities, buffered risk and increased resilience in farming enterprises. A clear implication of this study is that policymakers should engage with farmers when planning for a resilient agriculture in a variable climate scenario.

"Background: Latino preschoolers (3-5 year old children) have among the highest rates of obesity. Low levels of physical activity (PA) are a risk factor for obesity. Characterizing what Latino parents do to encourage or discourage their preschooler to be physically active can help inform interventions to increase their PA. The objective was therefore to develop and assess the psychometrics of a new instrument: the Preschooler Physical Activity Parenting Practices (PPAPP) among a Latino sample, to assess parenting practices used to encourage or discourage PA among preschool-aged children. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 240 Latino parents who reported the frequency of using PA parenting practices. 95% of respondents were mothers; 42% had more than a high school education. Child mean age was 4.5 (+/- 0.9) years (52% male). Test-retest reliability was assessed in 20%, 2 weeks later. We assessed the fit of a priori models using Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). In a separate sub-sample (35%), preschool-aged children wore accelerometers to assess associations with their PA and PPAPP subscales. Results: The a-priori models showed poor fit to the data. A modified factor structure for encouraging PPAPP had one multiple-item scale: engagement (15 items), and two single-items (have outdoor toys; not enroll in sport-reverse coded). The final factor structure for discouraging PPAPP had 4 subscales: promote inactive transport (3 items), promote screen time (3 items), psychological control (4 items) and restricting for safety (4 items). Test-retest reliability (ICC) for the two scales ranged from 0.56-0.85. Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.5-0.9. Several sub-factors correlated in the expected direction with children's objectively measured PA. Conclusion: The final models for encouraging and discouraging PPAPP had moderate to good fit, with moderate to excellent test-retest reliabilities. The PPAPP should be further evaluated to better assess its associations with children's PA and offers a new tool for measuring PPAPP among Latino families with preschool-aged children.","O'Connor, Teresia M.

"IntroductionLong-term care engagement of women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential to effective HIV public health measures. We sought to explore factors associated with a history of HIV treatment interruption among pregnant women living with HIV presenting to an antenatal clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional study of pregnant women living with HIV who had a history of ART interruption presenting for antenatal care. Women were categorized as either retained in HIV treatment or reinitiating care after loss-to-follow up (LTFU). To understand factors associated with treatment interruption, we surveyed socio-demographic and partner relationship characteristics. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with ART interruption were estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust variance. We additionally present patients' reasons for ART interruption. ResultsWe enrolled 541 pregnant women living with HIV (391 retained and 150 reinitiating). The median age was 30 years (interquartile range (IQR): 25-34). Factors associated with a history of LTFU were age <30 years (aPR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.33-1.63), less than a primary school education (aPR 1.25; CI: 1.08-1.46), initiation of ART during pregnancy or breastfeeding (aPR 1.49, CI: 1.37-1.65), nondisclosure of HIV serostatus to their partner (aPR 1.39, CI: 1.24-1.58), lack of awareness of partner's HIV status (aPR 1.41, CI: 1.27-1.60), and no contraception use at conception (aPR 1.60, CI 1.40-1.98). Access to care challenges were the most common reasons reported by women for treatment interruption (e.g., relocation, transport costs, or misplacing health documentation). ConclusionsInterventions that simplify the ART clinic transfer process, facilitate partner disclosure, and provide counseling about the importance of lifelong ART beyond pregnancy and breastfeeding should be further evaluated for improving retention in ART treatment of women living with HIV in Malawi.","Sasse, Simone L.

"Background The world population is aging very rapidly and the impact is more severe in developing countries because of insufficient resources and low awareness of the challenges faced by older people. This study aimed to explore multimorbidity of older people in Myanmar and their health seeking behaviours. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in both urban and rural areas of Bago Region and Mon State during October 2016. A multistage sampling method was used to select 4,859 people aged 60 years and older. Participants were interviewed face-to-face using a questionnaire. Multinominal logistic regression was used to analyse data. Results More than half of the study participants (57.9%) reported at least one chronic condition in the last year and 33.2% reported two or more conditions (multimorbidity). The common conditions were hypertension (67.3%), arthritis (24.7%), arrhythmia (14.7%), coronary heart disease (13.8%) and diabetes (13.7%). A majority (61.7%) of participants with a chronic condition took western medicine. Older people usually saw a doctor (60.2%) or health assistant (21.9%) at a nearby clinic or rural health center; 1.6% reported seeing uncredentialed medical persons. Factors associated with multimorbidity were being female (adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR) = 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63-2.82) and having fair (aPR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.59-3.04) or poor self-reported health (aPR = 3.93, 95% CI 2.79-5.52). Those with less than middle school education (aPR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.25-0.99) and those living in rural areas (aPR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98) were less likely to have multimorbidity. Older people in rural areas had less access to health care than their urban counterparts. Conclusion Chronic conditions are common among older people in Myanmar, with higher prevalence in women and in urban areas. The lower prevalence of chronic conditions in those who live in rural areas may be related to living a more traditional lifestyle.","Aye, San Kyu Kyu Hlaing, Hlaing Hlaing Htay, San San Cumming, Robert",e0219543,"Aye, SKK Hlaing, HH Htay, SS Cumming, R",,"[Aye, San Kyu Kyu; Hlaing, Hlaing Hlaing] Univ Med Mandalay, Dept Prevent & Social Med, Mandalay, Myanmar.

"BackgroundIn 2021, Uganda's neonatal mortality rate was approximately 19 deaths per 1000 live births, with an estimated stillbirth rate of 15.1 per 1000 total births. Data are critical for indicating areas where deaths occur and why, hence driving improvements. Many countries rely on surveys like Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), which face challenges with respondents' misinterpretation of questions. However, little is documented about this in Uganda. Cognitive interviews aim to improve questionnaires and assess participants' comprehension of items. Through cognitive interviews we explored women's interpretations of questions on pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes.MethodsIn November 2021, we conducted cognitive interviews with 20 women in Iganga Mayuge health and demographic surveillance system site in eastern Uganda. We adapted the reproductive section of the DHS VIII women's questionnaire, purposively selected questions and used concurrent verbal probing. Participants had secondary school education and were English speaking. Cognition was measured through comparing instructions in the DHS interviewers' manual to participants' responses and researcher's knowledge. A qualitative descriptive approach to analysis was undertaken.ResultsWe report findings under the cognitive aspect of comprehension. Some questions were correctly understood, especially those with less technical terms or without multiple sections. Most participants struggled with questions asking whether the woman has her living biological children residing with her or not. Indeed, some thought it referred to how many living children they had. There were comprehension difficulties with long questions like 210 that asks about miscarriages, newborn deaths, and stillbirths together. Participants had varying meanings for miscarriages, while many misinterpreted stillbirth, not linking it to gestational age. Furthermore, even amongst educated women some survey questions were misunderstood.ConclusionsPopulation surveys may misclassify, over or under report events around pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. Interviewers should begin with a standard definition of key terms and ensure respondents understand these. Questions can be simplified through breaking up long sentences, while interviewer training should be modified to ensure they thoroughly understand key terms. We recommend cognitive interviews while developing survey tools, beyond basic pre-testing. Improving respondents' comprehension and thus response accuracy will increase reporting and data quality.","Kwesiga, Doris Malqvist, Mats Orach, Christopher Garimoi Eriksson, Leif Blencowe, Hannah Waiswa, Peter",14,"Kwesiga, D Malqvist, M Orach, CG Eriksson, L Blencowe, H Waiswa, P",,"[Kwesiga, Doris; Malqvist, Mats; Eriksson, Leif] Uppsala Univ, Dept Womens & Childrens Hlth, Uppsala, Sweden.

"Objective: The Public Health Center Vaccine Survey (PHCVS) examines the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about seasonal influenza and H1N1 vaccinations in a largely low-income, urban, public health clinic population in Los Angeles County, USA. Design: A cross-sectional survey of vulnerable individuals at risk for severe influenza infection was conducted in one of the nation's largest local public health jurisdictions. Subjects: A total of 1541 clinic patients were recruited in the waiting rooms of five large public health centers in Los Angeles County from June to August, 2010. Results: Among prospective respondents who met eligibility criteria, 92% completed the survey. The majority was black or Latino and most were between the ages of 18 and 44 years. More than half were unemployed; two-thirds had no health insurance; and nearly one-half reported having a high school education or less. About one-fifth reported they had received the Hi NI vaccine during the previous flu season. In comparative analyses, negative beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy were highly predictive of H1N1 vaccination. Blacks were less likely than non-black respondents to report receiving the H1N1 vaccine (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.6-1.0). Blacks were also less likely than other respondents to agree that vaccines can prevent disease (OR = 0.4, 95% Cl = 0.3-0.5), that vaccines are safe (OR = 0.5,95% CI = 0.4-0.6), and that they trust doctors/clinicians who recommend vaccines (OR = 0.5, 95% Cl = 0.4-0.7). Conclusions: Study findings provide a useful risk profile of vulnerable groups in Los Angeles County, which may be generalizable to other urban jurisdictions in the United States. They also describe real world situations that can be used to forecast potential challenges that vaccine beliefs may pose to national as well as local influenza pandemic planning and response, especially for communities with limited access to these preventive services.

"Theoretical Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting consequences led to new family challenges (e. g., school and daycare closings, home office). Studies examining the variety of experiences are scarce. Objective: We examined (1) what burdened families the most during the pandemic, (2) whether there were positive changes in families, and (3) what resources helped parents to manage the crisis. Method: We conducted an online survey in August 2020 in Germany with N = 4 967 parents (87.6% female, 86.7% higher school education) with minor children (0-17 years), We analysed their answers to three open-ended-questions: (1) ""Overall, what caused you the most stress during the pandemic?"" (2) ""What has changed for the better during the pandemic?"" (3) ""What helped you the most during the pandemic?"". We used an inductive approach and developed a category system based on the answers. We analysed the frequencies of developed categories using MAXQDA (VERBI Software, 2019). Results: Parents were stressed most by the difficult compatibility of job and family life (12.0%), worries about the progression of the pandemic (11.1%), and the closure of care facilities and education institutions (8.5%). On the other hand, parents also reported positive changes that emerged from the pandemic: more gratitude and new attitudes (16.1 %); closer relationships within the family (13.0 %); and more time to spend with others (10.6%). Family resources were: social interaction within the family (19.1 %), outside family life (10.9%), and increased positive activities (13.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our results provide insight into the individual experiences of families during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Based on the results, needs-and family-based interventions can be derived that focus on reducing the burden, on maintaining the positive changes on a long-term basis, and on strengthening family resources. Examples are opening child-care facilities, establishing flexible work arrangements, allowing social contact in social bubbles. providing information on actions, strengthening media competence, providing positive activities, training awareness for positive changes and resources. and disseminating support measures.","Engelke, Lara Calvano, Claudia Klingbeil, Karoline Rolle, Mira Winter, Sibylle M.

"Health care systems and hospitals in several countries have implemented Fracture Liaison Services (FLSs). Success rates of FLSs with regard to osteoporosis assessment and treatment, fracture reduction, and adherence to osteoporosis medications have been reported by several groups including ours. A significant drop-out rate among patients in these programs may occur. This has not been evaluated before. We explored the factors correlating with nonadherence among a multiethnic population of patients in the FLS at our institution, the largest tertiary teaching hospital in South East Asia. Our secondary objective was to explore whether patients who defaulted follow-up visits continued to be compliant with medications. A retrospective analysis of our FLS's computerized database was performed. Of 938 patients followed up more than 2 years, 237 defaulted at various time points. A significant percentage of patients who dropped out of the program opined that it was because the follow-up visits were too time consuming. Non-Chinese patients were more likely than Chinese (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.98, 1.33-2.94), patients with primary school education and below were more likely than those with secondary school and above education (aHR = 1.65, 1.11-2.45) and those with nonvertebral and/or multiple fractures were more likely than those with spine fractures (aHR = 1.38, 1.06-1.81) to be nonadherent. A fraction of patients who defaulted continued to fill osteoporosis medication prescriptions. Median medication possession ratio among the patients who defaulted was 12.3% (interquartile range: 4.1%-36.7%) at 2 years. Persistence ranged from 15.1% to 20.8% and from 1.9% to 7.5% at 1 and 2 years, respectively after defaulting from the program. Our study, which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind, provides insight into the factors correlating with nonadherence to FLSs. Knowledge of the challenges faced by patients may be of help to health care providers interested in developing FLSs.","Chandran, Manju Cheen, Mcvin Ying, Hao Lau, Tang Ching Tani, Matthew",,"Chandran, M Cheen, M Ying, H Lau, TC Tani, M",117,"[Chandran, Manju; Tani, Matthew] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Osteoporosis & Bone Metab Unit, Singapore, Singapore.

"Challenges and tensions that arise in a pluralistic society with differing worldviews among its citizens must be addressed from the outset in school education. To enable social cohesion within a heterogeneous society, students must learn to harmonize their own worldviews with other interpretations of the world in a spirit of ""reciprocal inclusivity"" (Reinhold Bernhardt). This article argues that this task particularly falls within the responsibility of subjects in schools that address the existential ""problems of constitutive rationality"" (J & uuml;rgen Baumert), specifically religious education, ethics, and philosophy. In Germany and Austria, multiple subjects within denominational religious education, as well as ethics and philosophy, are offered in schools. When these subjects collaborate on projects, students learn to engage in dialogue with the various religious and secular, individual, and collective interpretations, perspectives, and worldviews they encounter. Since 2002/03, and in teacher training since 2011, such a didactically guided Sharing Worldviews approach has been implemented in school projects in Southern Germany through a four-phase concept. This concept can be flexibly applied to the local conditions of the school, contributes to internationalisation and digitalisation, and does not require additional teaching hours. By incorporating secular worldviews, Sharing Worldviews goes beyond interreligious learning and has also been realised digitally in other European countries. The following article begins by considering the educational requirements in a heterogeneous society (1), describes the prerequisites needed to positively influence students' attitudes (2), outlines common foundational concepts for interreligious and inter-worldview dialogue (3), and recommends ""Mutual Hospitality"" as the basis for such dialogue in schools (4). The article then explains how ""Mutual Hospitality"" can be practically implemented in a four-phase concept of Sharing Worldviews both in schools and in teacher training (5 and 6) by tracing the origins of this concept (7). The Sharing Worldviews concept has been both internationalised and digitalised in schools and teacher education (8), aligns with the educational principles of the OECD (9), and demonstrates significant benefits in empirical studies (10).","Boehme, Katja",1077,"Boehme, K",,"[Boehme, Katja] Univ Educ Heidelberg, Inst Philosophy & Theol, Dept Catholic Theol Religious Educ, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,,,,,2025-01-19,social cohesion; Sharing Worldviews; interreligious learning; inter-worldview learning; dialogical learning; dialogue; mutual hospitality; communication skills; worldview education; interreligious encounter learning; ethics education; philosophy didactics; religious education,10.3390/rel15091077,Article,,2077-1444,boehme@ph-heidelberg.de,,,"Erasmus+ project ""Sharing Worldviews: Learning in Encounter for Common Values"" (2021-2024) [2021-2024]","Erasmus+ project ""Sharing Worldviews: Learning in Encounter for Common Values"" (2021-2024).",H4A2L,,9,RELIGIONS,Religions,English,,49,gold,,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",SEP,16,BASEL,,,J,MDPI,2024,,"Boehme, K (corresponding author), Univ Educ Heidelberg, Inst Philosophy & Theol, Dept Catholic Theol Religious Educ, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",Religion,,,RELIGIONS,,,0,"""Sharing Worldviews: Learning in Encounter for Common Values in Diversity"" in School and Teacher Education-Contexts in Germany and Europe",0,0,WOS:001322879600001,15,,Religion,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),0
"Objectives C ondomless anal intercourse contributes significantly to the spread of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM). Factors related to condomless anal intercourse with known HIV-positive partners among MSM are not well understood. The authors describe factors associated with inconsistent condom use with known HIV-positive partners prior to participants' diagnosis with HIV. Methods N ew York City health department disease intervention specialists interviewed newly HIV-diagnosed MSM ages >= 13 years reporting knowingly having anal sex with HIV-positive partners between June 2013 and October 2014. Univariate and bivariate statistics were calculated, in addition to logistic regression analysis. Results A mong 95 MSM interviewed, 56% were >30 years and 74% had higher than a high school education. Respondents reported a median of 2 known HIV-positive sex partners. Drug or alcohol use during last sex with their last known HIV-positive partner was reported by 53% of participants. Sixty-five per cent of participants reported inconsistent condom use with last known HIV-positive partner. Inconsistent condom use with all HIV-positive partners was higher among individuals reporting two or more known HIV-positive partners since sexual debut than among those with one (90% vs 59%, p<0.01) and among those reporting feelings of love/emotional attachment as a reason for having sex (85% vs 63%, p=0.02). In the bivariate logistic regression models for inconsistent condom use, feelings of love or emotional attachment were the only significant predictor of inconsistent condom use (OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.23 to 9.58). After adjusting for confounding, the relationship feelings of love or emotional attachment continued to be the only significant predictor of inconsistent condom use (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.06 to 12.82). Conclusions Surveyed MSM engaged in high-risk behaviours, including condomless anal sex and drug or alcohol use during sex with persons known to be HIVpositive. These findings can inform interventions with MSM in serodiscordant partnerships.","Burton, Nicole Theresa Misra, Kavita Bocour, Angelica Shah, Sharmila Gutierrez, Rodolfo Udeagu, Chi-Chi",,"Burton, NT Misra, K Bocour, A Shah, S Gutierrez, R Udeagu, CC",108,"[Burton, Nicole Theresa; Misra, Kavita; Bocour, Angelica; Shah, Sharmila; Gutierrez, Rodolfo; Udeagu, Chi-Chi] New York City Dept Hlth & Mental Hyg, Field Serv Unit, Long Isl City, NY 11101 USA.",New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene,,,,,2025-01-19,,10.1136/sextrans-2017-053479,Article,,1472-3263,nburton@health.nyc.gov,114,,"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, HIV Epidemiology and Field Services Program; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [PS08-80202, U62/CCU223595]","This work was supported by a cooperative agreement between the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, HIV Epidemiology and Field Services Program, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (PS08-80202, #U62/CCU223595).",ID7ND,PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS PREP; RISK BEHAVIORS; UNITED-STATES; SAN-FRANCISCO; GAY; MSM; CHALLENGES; STRATEGIES; INTIMACY; PEOPLE,2,SEX TRANSM INFECT,Sex.

"Background: Acute illness challenges all families with young children. The Health-e-Access Telemedicine Network in Rochester, NY, has enabled > 7,000 telemedicine visits since 2001 among children in childcare or elementary schools, predominantly from Rochester's inner city. Large reductions in illness-related absence and emergency department use among Health-e-Access participants have occurred. Objective: The study was aimed to assess parent perception of telemedicine as a means to reduce burdens associated with childhood illness. Design/Methods: A total of 800 parents were surveyed before (578) or after (318) a child had at least one Health-e-Access visit. Queries addressed access to healthcare, conflicts between work/school and child's care during illness, and concerns and likes about telemedicine. Perceptions were elicited through open-ended and direct queries. Results: Among all respondents, 16% had high-school education and 25% had a college education. Race/ethnicity of the respondents included black (43.6%), Hispanic (22.9%), white (30.0%), and other (3.5%). All identified a primary care practice as a source for well childcare. Most (58%) had given antipyretics to their child to avoid being called by childcare or elementary school staff about illness. Likert scale interview items addressing quality of care elicited low levels of worry or concern. Worry scores trended lower after experience. Among 532 comments about Health-e-Access elicited through open-ended probes, positive ones (likes) predominated 84.6%). Likes most commonly included convenience/time saved (33.6% of all comments), parent stayed at work (13.5%), drug delivered to child site (7.1%) or called ahead to pharmacy (4.9%), and confidence in care (2.3%). Negative responses (concerns) totaled 15.4% of comments and most commonly included reliability of diagnosis (2.6%), technical problems (1.3%), and preference for in-person care (0.8%). Conclusions: Health-e-Access was well accepted by a substantial, diverse group of parents despite unfamiliarity with this approach to care. Convenience and convenience-related experience dominated perceptions. This model enables service beyond that mandated by payers and beyond that generally provided by medical practices.","McConnochie, Kenneth M. Wood, Nancy E. Herendeen, Neil E. ten Hoopen, Cynthia B.

"Background Individuals with developmental disabilities, including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), often suffer from poorer oral health than the general population as they experience challenges with accessing care. However, few studies have investigated access to oral health care specific to children diagnosed with FASD. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study is to examine the use of oral health care services by children diagnosed with FASD in Saskatchewan, Canada, and to identify perceived barriers that affect their access to oral health care. Methods Parents or caregivers for children with FASD under the age of 16 were recruited through community organizations. Between July 2020 and January 2021, 189 participants completed a 64-item questionnaire that assessed sociodemographic characteristics, oral health care utilization, and perceived barriers to care. Results Most children (85%) had visited the dentist within the last 24 months. 55% of children had required sedation for some treatment. 43% of caregivers experienced frustration trying to access care for their child. Common barriers were cost (63%), location (55%), the child's behaviour (78%) and caregiver anxiety (60%). 35% of caregivers believed their dentist lacked adequate knowledge of FASD. Univariate analysis reveals that income, caregiver education, residence location, and insurance status were significantly associated with reporting barriers. Multivariate logistic regression analysis reveals that caregivers who reported a high school education (OR=1.23; 95% CI 1.03 - 1.38); or public insurance (OR=1.33; 95% CI 1.24 - 1.42) or out-of-pocket payments (OR=1.37, 95% CI 1.20 - 1.46); or rural (OR=1.19, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.26) or remote (OR=1.23; 95% CI=1.12 - 1.31) residences were more likely to report difficulties accessing oral health care. Conclusion Our findings indicate that children with FASD experience various barriers to accessing oral health care. Social determinants of health were significant variables that increased likelihood of barriers. Like other vulnerable populations, cost and clinic location are notable barriers. Oral health care providers' assessment and management of children with FASD are noteworthy for future research.","Hu, Katie Da Silva, Keith",497,"Hu, KT Da Silva, K",,"[Hu, Katie; Da Silva, Keith] Univ Saskatchewan, Coll Dent, 123-105 Wiggins Rd, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E4, Canada.",University of Saskatchewan,,,,,2025-01-19,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Developmental Disabilities; Health Services Accessibility,10.1186/s12903-022-02561-z,Article,,,keith.dasilva@usask.ca,,,University of Saskatchewan Faculty Recruitment and Retention Support Fund,"Funding for this project was through the University of Saskatchewan Faculty Recruitment and Retention Support Fund (KD), and through a student stipend through the University of Saskatchewan BSc in Dentistry Program (KH).",6I4VR,DENTAL-CARE; INEQUALITIES; DISABILITIES; NEEDS,1,BMC ORAL HEALTH,BMC Oral Health,English,,23,"gold, Green Published",,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",NOV 16,8,LONDON,36384583,,J,BMC,2022,,"Da Silva, K (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Coll Dent, 123-105 Wiggins Rd, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E4, Canada.","Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",,1472-6831,BMC ORAL HEALTH,,,5,Access to oral health care for children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: a cross-sectional study,0,3,WOS:000886126700012,22,,"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),5
"Mobile devices, such as iPads, are described as supporting 'anywhere, anytime' learning by enabling students to move fluidly between at-school and beyond-school contexts. However, research on mobile digital tools in schools has largely been preoccupied with issues of design and implementation rather than with how mobile devices transform the nature of learning per se, and the identities of students both at school and beyond. In this paper, we draw on Bakhtin to explore the dialogical self-making of iPad-using students as they take up and resist various identities mediated by these cultural tools. Our focus requires a research methodology that accounts for the fluid nature of identity, and considers digital tools as mediational means deployed by students in knowledge-making as well as self-making. We illustrate how Bakhtin's view of the self as inherently dialogic - I-for-myself, 'I-for-the-other' and 'the-other-for-me'-provides insight into how and why particular identities are taken up or rejected by students in the fluid movement between lifeworlds at school and beyond. We adopt a reflexive microethnographic research approach to capture the identity work undertaken by iPad-using students in a high school where everyone in Year 11 and Year 12 had received iPads to assist with their learning. In this paper, we report our in-depth analysis of one student, Phoebe, whose self-making shifts in nuanced and subtle ways in relation to the device. We see Phoebe deploy the iPad to render a dialogical version of who she is and might become, comparing herself across time to her past and future selves as well as in relation to others in her social world. Our analysis makes visible how Phoebe negotiated and traversed the challenges of relational self-making, both in relation to iPads and to others including the dynamic multiplicity of her own voices. In this way, we demonstrate how a Bakhtinian perspective can be theoretically and methodologically responsive to the fluidity and complexity of twenty-first century learning and learning contexts.

"Background: There is a common perception that tall stature results in social dominance. Evidence in meerkats suggests that social dominance itself may be a strong stimulus for growth. Relative size serves as the signal for individuals to induce strategic growth adjustments. Aim: We construct a thought experiment to explore the potential consequences of the question: is stature a social signal also in humans? We hypothesize that (1) upward trends in height in the lower social strata are perceived as social challenges yielding similar though attenuated upward trends in the dominant strata, and that (2) democratization, but also periods of political turmoil that facilitate upward mobility of the lower strata, are accompanied by upward trends in height. Material and methods: We reanalyzed large sets of height data of European conscripts born between 1856-1860 and 1976-1980; and annual data of German military conscripts, born between 1965 and 1985, with information on height and school education. Results: Taller stature is associated with higher socioeconomic status. Historic populations show larger height differences between social strata that tend to diminish in the more recent populations. German height data suggest that both democratization, and periods of political turmoil facilitating upward mobility of the lower social strata are accompanied by a general upward height spiral that captures the whole population. Discussion: We consider stature as a signal. Nutrition, health, general living conditions and care giving are essential prerequisites for growth, yet not to maximize stature, but to allow for its function as a lifelong social signal. Considering stature as a social signal provides an elegant explanation of the rapid height adjustments observed in migrants, of the hitherto unexplained clustering of body height in modern and historic cohorts of military conscripts, and of the parallelism between changes in political conditions, and secular trends in adult human height since the 19th century.","Hermanussen, Michael Scheffler, Christiane",,"Hermanussen, M Scheffler, C",265,"[Hermanussen, Michael] Aschauhof 3, D-24340 Altenhof, Germany.

"Objectives. Pediatric resident continuity practices provide care to more than one fifth of the socioeconomically disadvantaged population of the United States. With the structural challenges of resident training, there may be concerns about a lower quality of care received by patients. The objectives of this study were to measure parental perception of resident primary care, to determine the characteristics associated with better care, and to compare perception with a previously published community standard. Methods. A cross-sectional survey using the Parents' Perception of Primary Care was conducted of patients enrolled at 19 national academically affiliated resident continuity practices from the Continuity Research Network. Outcome measures included mean total scale score for the Parents' Perception of Primary Care and mean scores for each primary care domain. Comparisons were made between the subset of resident patients who were older than 5 years and a previously published community survey of parents of school-age children. Results. A total of 2572 patients were enrolled with a final sample size of 2211 analyzable surveys. The sample was 37% black and 40% Hispanic; 81% of the children had Medicaid insurance; and 20% of the parents had less than a high school education. Parents rated the care that they received in resident continuity with high total scores and subscale scores, with an overall mean total scale score of 74.0. Higher scores were associated with number of visits to the provider and being able to name the resident as the primary care provider, whereas minority status was associated with lower access and communication scores. The resident sample over age 5 had higher mean scores for the total scale and every domain as compared with the community sample. Conclusions. Parents of patients at resident continuity sites rated residents as providers of high-quality care to a socioeconomically disadvantaged population as compared with a previously published community sample. Efforts to improve resident continuity and identification may help improve care delivered in resident practices.","Krugman, Scott D.

"Citizen science can facilitate in-depth learning for pupils and students, contribute to scientific research, and permit civic participation. Here, we describe the development of the transnational school-based citizen science project Phenology of the North Calotte. Its primary goal is to introduce pupils (age 12-15; grades 7-10) in northern Norway, Russia, and Finland to the local and global challenges of climate change resulting in life cycle changes at different trophic and ecosystem levels in their backyards. Partnerships between regional scientists and staff from NIBIO Svanhovd, State nature reserves, national parks, and teachers and pupils from regional schools aim to engage pupils in project-based learning. The project uses standardized protocols, translated into the different languages of participating schools. The phenological observations are centered around documenting clearly defined life cycle phases (e.g., first appearance of species, flowering, ripening, leaf yellowing, snow fall, and melt). The observations are collected either on paper and are subsequently submitted manually to an open-source online database or submitted directly via a newly developed mobile app. In the long term, the database is anticipated to contribute to research studying changes in phenology at different trophic levels. In principle, guided school-based citizen science projects have the potential to contribute to increased environmental awareness and education and thereby to transformative learning at the societal level while contributing to scientific progress of understudied biomes, like the northern taiga and (sub)arctic tundra. However, differences in school systems and funding insecurity for some schools have been major prohibiting factors for long-term retention of pupils/schools in the program. Project-based and multidisciplinary learning, although pedagogically desired, has been partially difficult to implement in participating schools, pointing to the need of structural changes in national school curricula and funding schemes as well as continuous offers for training and networking for teachers.","Klutsch, Cornelya F.

"Water treatment processes are designed to ensure that any pollutant's adverse effects on the environment are reduced to the minimum allowable discharge limit. Water-literate individuals ought to effectively and constantly think about novel hydrologic concepts to improve the quality and sufficiency of water. Socio-hydrological issues remain the main source of water pollution and insufficiency in society. Therefore, effective water management and treatment require societal understanding. The complexity of water issues requires equipping STEM education students with the necessary knowledge to acquire water solution reasoning skills. However, STEM students need meaningful challenges with everyday connections to capture their interest to apply intuitive understanding in project-based learning. Water-related issues such as high turbidity are ubiquitous problems facing communities. This study specifically explored how project-based learning can be harnessed to enhance STEM students' critical thinking skills using water treatment activities. The water treatment activity involved the development of novel products using agricultural wastes for efficient water treatment. The social issues associated with agricultural wastes, especially orange and banana peels in the environment, are too obvious to be overlooked; hence, they were chosen as base materials to develop water treatment products. The study adopted an action research design and involved 12 purposively selected third-year Bachelor of Science students majoring in Chemistry at a South African university. The students were divided into two groups consisting of six participants. The researchers implemented team teaching and invoked students' knowledge of Earth Science, Physics, Chemistry, and Technology to develop and implement laboratory experimental activities and class-based lesson plans. The empirical investigation was underpinned by the Five Steps of Project-Based Learning as the underlying theoretical framework. The chemistry of the processed peels such as particle size and functional groups provided insight into the mechanism responsible for water turbidity reduction. Laboratory experimental results revealed that the turbidity reduction obtained from the use of processed banana peels was higher than the processed orange peels coagulant. However, the performance of both coagulants in turbidity reduction complied with the South African National Standard (SANS241) for drinking water quality.","Oyewo, Opeyemi A.

"This study aims to investigate how online collaboration can support the learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in higher education. Empirical data were collected from 88 postgraduate students studying at the African Centre of Excellence for Innovative Teaching Learning Mathematics and Science (ACEITLMS) using online oral interviews and two five-point Likert scale questionnaires. Interviews were analysed through content analysis while data from the questionnaire were scanned through the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) to compute descriptive statistics and Spearman rho correlation coefficient. The findings indicate that online collaborative learning through small group discussions prompt knowledge co-construction, and higher-order thinking skills in STEM subjects. Moreover, the findings demonstrate how several electronic multimedia tools (PhET simulations, animations, YouTube videos) can increase student retention and engagement in learning STEM. Though the students reported that they experienced challenges such as poor internet connection, lack of laboratory work, electricity shortage, and limited ICT skills, they managed to complete STEM learning activities by using free virtual laboratories, portable tethering hotspots from their smartphones, and smartphones where power was a problem and learnt the navigation of ICT tools from their peers. The study found moderate positive Spearman rho correlation coefficient, rs = 0.69, P < 0.01 which explains that 69% of the total variance in the students' successful performance is explained by the two variables, i.e., social and cognitive presence. The study recommends more training for course instructors and students. Efforts should be put in place to focus on ICT manipulation and curating interactive content. The researchers acclaim the expansion of internet coverage in University of Rwanda campuses. This action will enhance online and blended learning. Moreover, the study recommends the integration of ICT and the use of multimedia tools such as Bio-interactive and Physics Education Technology (PhET) interactive simulations in STEM subjects as supplementary resources. These tools support cognitive and affective domains in the teaching and learning process. Furthermore, universities can reduce the problem of expensive and inadequate laboratory equipment by adopting the use of virtual laboratories, especially for online STEM lessons.","Nungu, Leonard Mukama, Evode Nsabayezu, Ezechiel",,"Nungu, L Mukama, E Nsabayezu, E",10865,"[Nungu, Leonard; Mukama, Evode; Nsabayezu, Ezechiel] Univ Rwanda, Coll Educ UR CE, African Ctr Excellence Innovat Teaching & Learning, Rukara Campus, Kigali, Rwanda.

"Background: Churches are effective community partners and settings to address weight management among African Americans. There is limited information on the use of churches to reach young adult populations and church collaborations with primary care clinics. Objectives: The Church Bridge Project represents a community-academic partnership that presents the recruitment process of a church-based weight management intervention and describes baseline data of participants recruited from churches and primary care providers. We also discuss research contributions, challenges and limitations, study applicability, and practice implications from an academic and community perspective. Methods: Church leaders were involved in the entire research process. The theory-driven intervention included 12 diabetes prevention program-adapted education and motivational interviewing (MI)-guided sessions. Participants were recruited through primary care providers and church leaders. Demographics, medical and weight history, stage of change for weight loss, social support, and self-efficacy for diet and physical activity, weight, and girth circumferences were measured. Baseline descriptive data were analyzed. Results: Of 64 potential participants, 42 (65.6%) were enrolled in the study and 16 (25.0%) completed baseline data collection. No participants were recruited through primary care providers. Recruited participants were similar to the target population except for being all obese and mostly female. The mean +/- SD age of participants was 34.31 +/- 8.86 years with most reporting having more than a high school education (n = 14 [87.5%]), individual yearly income of less than $59,000 (n = 12 [75.0%]), and been married or living with a partner (n = 9 [56.3%]). Most reported a history of hypertension and an immediate family history of diabetes and hypertension. Most participants were classified as class III obesity. Conclusions: Young adults and primary care providers are difficult to engage in church-based interventions. Church leaders were comfortable with a collaborate model for decision making, but not an empower model. Churches remain a successful method to reach African Americans; however, more research is needed to motivate young adults to participate in health intervention research.","Lemacks, Jennifer L.

"Environmental perspectives are shaped by both affective and cognitive domains of education. In the urbanizing municipality of Balanga City, the primary school students of its 19 public schools were reported to have a skewed perspective of the environment, equating the term to only the natural components of their surroundings. This does not prevent the students from being actively concerned about the environment, but their confusion is aggravated by the contrasting habits observed in their households to those taught in school. Education is only a limited means to help develop sustainable practices needed as the global community addresses the challenges brought by climate change so to determine how to further develop the environmental knowledge of primary school students in Balanga City, and the influences enumerated by the children of its public schools were studied. Based on the students' response, their school and television provide the fundamentals for their understanding of the environment, but the social atmosphere in their homes causes the trivialization of the environmental information they acquire. The ease by which these students are compelled to let go of environment-friendly habits may be caused by the absence of a solid cognitive foundation of environmental science due to the integrated curriculum design for teaching science to elementary students and the lack of sufficient training of the teachers involved. Although reiteration and emphasis of learned environmental principles in school can also come from mass media, the forms the students are exposed to are local and subject to sensationalism. There is a lack of sufficient infrastructure needed to expose the students to global viewpoints and issues about the environment, while those with immediate family members overseas have limited avenues for sharing their external influences. Involving the family in environmental education is the key, together with proper training of faculty and a modification of how environmental science is taught, to create an effective system for the improvement of the environmental perspectives of the children of Balanga City. Though environmental education may rely on the linearity of communication, the meeting point of the social influences of these children should emphasize the values of environmental stewardship for them to ascertain the right perspectives toward the environment.","Cruz, Chona Camille E.

"Ensuring and measuring adherence to prescribed exercise regimens are fundamental challenges in intervention studies to promote exercise in adults with cancer. This study reports exercise adherence in women who were asked to walk 150 min/week throughout chemotherapy treatment for early breast cancer. Participants were asked to wear a Fitbit(TM) throughout their waking hours, and Fitbit steps were uploaded directly into study computers. Descriptive statistics are reported, and both unadjusted and multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations between participant characteristics, breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, chemotherapy toxicities, and patient-reported symptoms with average Fitbit steps/week. Of 127 women consented to the study, 100 had analyzable Fitbit data (79%); mean age was 48 and 31% were non-white. Mean walking steps were 3956 per day. Nineteen percent were fully adherent with the target of 6686 steps/day and an additional 24% were moderately adherent. In unadjusted analysis, baseline variables associated with fewer Fitbit steps were: non-white race (p = 0.012), high school education or less (p = 0.0005), higher body mass index (p = 0.0024), and never/almost never drinking alcohol (p = 0.0048). Physical activity variables associated with greater Fitbit steps were: pre-chemotherapy history of vigorous physical activity (p = 0.0091) and higher self-reported walking minutes/week (p < 0.001), and higher outcome expectations from exercise (p = 0.014). Higher baseline anxiety (p = 0.03) and higher number of chemotherapy-related symptoms rates ""severe/very severe"" (p = 0.012) were associated with fewer steps. In multivariable analysis, white race was associated with 12,146 greater Fitbit steps per week (p = 0.004), as was self-reported walking minutes prior to start of chemotherapy (p < 0.0001). Inexpensive commercial-grade activity trackers, with data uploaded directly into research computers, enable objective monitoring of home-based exercise interventions in adults diagnosed with cancer. Analysis of the association of walking steps with participant characteristics at baseline and toxicities during chemotherapy can identify reasons for low/non-adherence with prescribed exercise regimens.","Nyrop, K.

"Background: Despite its effectiveness in preventing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the rate of uptake of the HPV vaccine is low in Vietnam. This study aimed to investigate barriers related to knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) about the HPV vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) for the vaccine among those using services in an urban vaccination clinic in Hanoi, Vietnam. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a vaccination clinic of the Institute for Preventive Medicine and Public Health in Hanoi, Vietnam, from March to April 2016. KAP on the HPV vaccine was collected using a structured questionnaire. Double-bounded dichotomous-choice questions with open-ended questions were used to examine the WTP of respondents. Interval regression and stepwise logistic models were used to identify factors associated with WTP and the average amount that people would be willing to pay for the vaccine. Results: Of 492 vaccination service users, 67.9%, 94.6%, and 12.3% of respondents were aware of the best age for HPV vaccination, its benefits, and the target group for vaccination, respectively. While the majority believed that the HPV vaccine was safe (92.8%) and effective (90.8%), and desired to be vaccinated (71.1%), only 31.8% of users were vaccinated. Most of the respondents were willing to pay for the HPV vaccine (86.6%), and willing to pay an average amount of US$49.3. Those aged 20-29 years and earning more than 22 million VND/month (very rich) were more likely to pay for the HPV vaccine than people aged,20 years and earning,7 million VND/month. Users who had attained more than a high-school education and heard about the HPV vaccine from doctors, nurses, or other health professionals tended to be willing to pay for the vaccine at a lower price than individuals with below secondary-level education and who had not heard about the vaccine from these health professionals. Conclusion: Sexual health education and financial assistance should be imparted alongside the HPV vaccination program.","Tran, Bach Xuan Phung Tat Quoc Than Tien Thuy Ngoc Doan Huong Lan Thi Nguyen Hue Thi Mai Trang Huyen Thi Nguyen Huong Thi Le Latkin, Carl A.

"Background: Despite impressive decreases in under-five mortality, progress in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality in Tanzania has been slow. We present an evaluation of a cadre of maternal, newborn, and child health community health worker (MNCH CHW) focused on preventive and promotive services during the antenatal and postpartum periods in Morogoro Region, Tanzania. Study findings review the effect of several critical design elements on knowledge, time allocation, service delivery, satisfaction, and motivation. Methods: A quantitative survey on service delivery and knowledge was administered to 228 (of 238 trained) MNCH CHWs. Results are compared against surveys administered to (1) providers in nine health centers (n = 88) and (2) CHWs (n = 53) identified in the same districts prior to the program's start. Service delivery outputs were measured by register data and through a time motion study conducted among a sub-sample of 33 randomly selected MNCH CHWs. Results: Ninety-seven percent of MNCH CHWs (n = 228) were interviewed: 55% male, 58% married, and 52% with secondary school education or higher. MNCH CHWs when compared to earlier CHWs were more likely to be unmarried, younger, and more educated. Mean MNCH CHW knowledge scores were <50% for 8 of 10 MNCH domains assessed and comparable to those observed for health center providers but lower than those for earlier CHWs. MNCH CHWs reported covering a mean of 186 households and were observed to provide MNCH services for 5 h weekly. Attendance of monthly facility-based supervision meetings was nearly universal and focused largely on registers, yet data quality assessments highlighted inconsistencies. Despite program plans to provide financial incentives and bicycles for transport, only 56% of CHWs had received financial incentives and none received bicycles. Conclusions: Initial rollout of MNCH CHWs yields important insights into addressing program challenges. The social profile of CHWs was not significantly associated with knowledge or service delivery, suggesting a broader range of community members could be recruited as CHWs. MNCH CHW time spent on service delivery was limited but comparable to the financial incentives received. Service delivery registers need to be simplified to reduce inconsistencies and yet expanded to include indicators on the timing of antenatal and postpartum visits.","LeFevre, Amnesty E.

"BackgroundMany children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) experience cognitive difficulties, impacting their academic, social, and emotional well-being. A Danish study from 2023 revealed that merely 40% of individuals with CP complete their elementary school education, and previous neuropsychological studies have found that most children and adolescents with CP experience cognitive difficulties. Yet, cognitive functioning is often assumed rather than assessed, and CP follow-up programs focus predominantly on physical functioning. Recognizing this gap, we aim to investigate cognitive functioning in children and adolescents with CP in mainstream schools in Denmark, using standardized neuropsychological tests. Our objective is to provide valuable insights to guide clinical practice on cognitive assessment and intervention, ultimately fostering a more effective support system for individuals with CP.MethodsThe study employs a cross-sectional design, involving 100 children and adolescents with CP aged 11-15 years attending mainstream schools in Denmark. Cognitive assessment includes the core battery from a proposed Nordic test protocol for children and adolescents with CP - the CPCog - encompassing general cognitive functioning (intelligence), executive functions, and visuo-motor skills. Supplementary tests cover verbal and nonverbal short-term memory, attention, fatigue, and mental health. The assessment protocol will also be evaluated by parents of participating children and adolescents with CP. The project is conducted collaboratively by the neuropsychological teams at three assessment sites, in conjunction with the Center for Cerebral Palsy, Rigshospitalet, Aarhus University Hospital, and Aalborg University Hospital. The study benefits from an external advisory board comprising leading international CP experts.DiscussionCognitive difficulties in children and adolescents with CP are often overlooked. Few cognitive studies exist, with some providing only estimated cognitive functioning. The CPCog-Youth study will help advance our understanding of the cognitive challenges experienced by children and adolescents attending mainstream schools. The findings will contribute to the development of targeted cognitive assessment and intervention programs for individuals with CP, addressing this commonly neglected aspect of care. By also seeking feedback from participating families and the involved neuropsychologists, we aim to investigate whether the proposed cognitive assessment is feasible and beneficial in real-world settings.Trial registrationThe study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on June 27, 2023 (ID: NCT05921422).","Uhre, Camilla Funch Caspersen, Ida Dyhr Lose, Carsten Rackauskaite, Gija Robotham, Ro Hoei-Hansen, Christina E.",836,"Uhre, CF Caspersen, ID Lose, C Rackauskaite, G Robotham, R Hoei-Hansen, CE",,"[Uhre, Camilla Funch; Caspersen, Ida Dyhr] Rigshosp, Ctr Clin Neuropsychol Children & Adolescents, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.

"As the twenty-first century opens, says Robert Balfanz, the United States is developing a deep social consensus that American high schools should ensure that all adolescents graduate from high school prepared for postsecondary schooling and training. Balfanz asks how well high schools are succeeding in this mission and whether they can ultimately fulfill it. Balfanz first surveys the structure and demographics of today's high schools. Forty percent of white students attend high schools that are 90 percent or more white, while roughly one-third of Latino and African American students attend high schools that are 90 percent or more minority. Minority students are also much more likely than white students to attend high schools that confront the challenges of concentrated poverty. In predominantly white, affluent suburban school districts, nearly every student arrives ready for high school work and then graduates. In all-minority inner city schools in high-poverty neighborhoods, most entering students lack a good middle school education and only half to two-thirds graduate. With only a third to a half of high school graduates today prepared to succeed in college, how likely is it that American high schools will succeed in their mission of preparing all students for additional schooling or training? Balfanz argues that reforms over the past twenty-five years offer some hope. The standards and accountability movement has made the American high school a more focused and academic place. College preparatory course-taking has increased substantially, as has standardized testing. Mandatory exit exams have been imposed. And during the past decade, in particular, reformers have made a concerted effort to improve the low-performing high schools that serve low-income and minority students. Investments by the federal government and by foundations have led to the development of several types of reforms that have been proven effective, thus raising hopes that the nation's lowest-performing high schools can better serve their students. Still, the American high school has a considerable way to go to be able to prepare all students for further schooling or training. To advance all its students, it must find a way to bring to scale the methods and mechanisms, conditions, and know-how that have enabled a few low-performing high schools to achieve this transformation.","Balfanz, Robert",,"Balfanz, R",17,"Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Social Org Sch, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",Johns Hopkins University,,,,,2025-01-19,,,Article,,1550-1558,,36,,,,445FF,,1,FUTURE CHILD,Future Child.,English,,64,,,"277 WALLACE HALL, PRINCETON, NJ 08544 USA",SPR,20,PRINCETON,21141703,,J,PRINCETON UNIV,2009,,"Balfanz, R (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Social Org Sch, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",Family Studies; Health Care Sciences & Services; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,1054-8289,FUTURE OF CHILDREN,,,17,Can the American High School Become an Avenue of Advancement for All?,0,11,WOS:000266034800002,19,,"Family Studies; Health Policy & Services; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),174
"Background: Increasing numbers of residency applications create challenges for applicants and residency programs to assess if they are a good fit during the residency application and match process. Applicants face limited or conflicting information as they assess programs, leading to overapplying. A holistic review of residency applications is considered a gold standard for programs, but the current volumes and associated time constraints leave programs relying on numerical filters, which do not predict success in residency. Applicants could benefit from increased transparency in the residency application process.Objective: This study aims to determine the information applicants find most beneficial from residency programs when deciding where to apply, by type of medical school education background.Methods: Match 2023 applicants voluntarily completed an anonymous survey through the Twitter and Instagram social media platforms. We asked the respondents to select 3 top factors from a multiple-choice list of what information they would like from residency programs to help determine if the characteristics of their application align with program values. We examined differences in helpful factors selected by medical school backgrounds using ANOVA.Results: There were 4649 survey respondents. When responses were analyzed by United States-allopathic (US-MD), doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO), and international medical graduate (IMG) educational backgrounds, respondents chose different factors as most helpful: minimum United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) or Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX) Step 2 scores (565/3042, 18.57% US-MD; 485/3042, 15.9% DO; and 1992/3042, 65.48% IMG; P<.001), resident hometown region (281/1132, 24.82% US-MD; 189/1132, 16.7% DO; and 662/1132, 58.48% IMG; P=.02), resident medical school region (476/2179, 22% US-MD; 250/2179, 11.5% DO; and 1453/2179, 66.7% IMG; P=.002), and percent of residents or attendings underrepresented in medicine (417/1815, 22.98% US-MD; 158/1815, 8.71% DO; and 1240/1815, 68.32% IMG; P<.001).Conclusions: When applying to residency programs, this study found that the factors that respondents consider most helpful from programs in deciding where to apply differ by educational background. Across all educational groups, respondents want transparency around standardized exam scores, geography, and the racial or ethnic backgrounds of residents and attendings.","Ulin, Lindsey Bernstein, Simone A.

"The article introduces the Inquiry Based Learning approach for innovative contemporary teaching STEAM subjects in primary and secondary school sectors. The Go-Lab ecosystem features are presented (https://www.golabz.eu). The Go-Lab repository offers the large set of educational apps, extensive collection of remote and virtual laboratories as well as more than thousands of Inquiry Learning Spaces (ILS) for blended and distance learning. The platform, which successfully is used in many school institutions throughout the globe, has become available in Ukraine due to the EU Programme ERASMUS + K2 ""Modernization of Pedagogical Higher Education by Innovative Teaching Instruments - MoPED"" (No. 586098-EPP-1-2017-1-UA-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP). The ILS as a personalized research environment for self-study of STEAM subjects is introduced. Using Go-Lab apps students can ask questions, formulate hypothesis, experiment, make a conclusion and discussion the getting results, therefore, developing critical thinking, research and scientific skills, and digital competence. In addition, the benefits of usage of virtual and remote labs in the classroom is demonstrated. The authors introduce open, guided, and structured types of Inquiry Based Learning applying integrated Go-Lab inquiry cycle, which consists of orientation, conceptualization, research, conclusions and discussion phases. This platform allows teachers create the own virtual Inquiry Learning Space, modify or use as it is existing ones, shared by other Go-Lab ecosystem users/teachers. The ILSs in Ukrainian presented in the article may work as an example of innovative learning materials to national educators who would like to empower their students with 21st century skills and competences as well as active online experimentations, solving real-life scientific problem and challenges, and independently learning practices. The assessment criteria for evaluating the students ILSs developed during the teaching IBL methodology at the Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University are outlined. At the same time, the necessity of development of new online laboratories fit to school education state standards and Ukrainian curriculum taking into account the contemporary pedagogical approaches and theories, such as inquiry based learning, motivational theories, cognitive load theory, experiential learning (reflection in or on action) is emphasized. The novelty of the scientific research is to substantiate the theoretical and methodological approaches of using Inquiry Based Learning of the Go-Lab ecosystem in the New Ukrainian School.","Budnyk, Olena Dziabenko, Olga",,"Budnyk, O Dziabenko, O",1,"[Budnyk, Olena] Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian Natl Univ, Dept Pedag Primary Educ, Ivano Frankivsk, Ukraine.

"BackgroundYoung adults that are not in education, training or employment represent a problem across European countries. While some are cases of temporary transitions or short-term inactivity, others represent a more vulnerable group at risk of early work disability. Early exclusion from the labor market represents long lives exposed to detrimental effects of unemployment on health and well-being, and constitutes an economic burden for society. There is need for more knowledge about young adults who are at risk of early work disability but have not yet reached the point of more permanent exclusion. This study aims to investigate social and health-related problems in a Norwegian sample of young adults at risk of early work disability, and their self-perceived causes of illness.MethodsBaseline data from participants in the SEED-trial (N=96), a randomized controlled trial comparing individual placement and support to traditional vocational rehabilitation in young adults at risk of early work disability, were analyzed. Background, health behaviors, adverse social experiences, disability level, physical and mental health, social support, coping, and self-perceived causal attributions of illness were measured. Gender differences were analyzed using chi-square and t-tests.ResultsMean age was 24, and 68% were men. One third reported reading and writing difficulties, and 40% had less than high-school education. The majority had experienced bullying (66%) or violence (39%), and 53% reported hazardous alcohol use. Psychological distress was the most prevalent health problem (52%), and women generally had more physical and mental health problems than men. Self-perceived causal attributions of illness were mainly related to relational problems, followed by health behaviors, heredity/genetics, and external environmental factors.ConclusionsThe study provides a deeper insight into a vulnerable group with substantial challenges related to adverse social experiences, psychological distress, and alcohol use, who emphasized relational problems as the main causal factor for their illness. Findings suggest a need for broader focus on psychological and social factors in vocational rehabilitation efforts targeting young adults at risk of early work disability. Furthermore, gender-specific approaches may be warranted and should be followed up in future studies.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov: NCT02375074.

"BackgroundDelays in diagnosis and treatment initiation may allow the emergence of new cases by transmission to the community, and is one of the challenges facing programme management of drug resistance in Myanmar. This study aimed to explore delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation, and associated factors among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted at Yangon Regional Tuberculosis Centre, Myanmar. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews and treatment-card reviews of all adult patients who had registered and started treatment with the standard regimen from May to November, 2017. Delay time was categorized by using median cut-off and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relative impact of predictor variables on diagnosis and treatment delays.ResultsA total of 210 patients participated in this study. The median diagnosis delay was 9days, IQR 3 (8-11) and 58.6% of the patients experienced a long diagnosis delay. Below middle school education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.75, 95% CI=1.22-6.21), non-permanent salaried employment (AOR=3.03, 95% CI=1.32-6.95), co-existing diabetes mellitus (AOR=5.06, 95% CI=1.97-13.01) and poor awareness (AOR=2.99, 95% CI=1.29-6.92) were independent predictors of long diagnosis delay. The median treatment delay was 13days, IQR 9 (8-17) and 51% of the patients experienced long treatment delay. Age 31-50years (AOR=4.50, 95% CI=1.47-13.97) and age>50years (AOR=9.40, 95% CI=2.55-34.83), history with MDR-TB patient (AOR=3.16, 95% CI=1.29-7.69), >20km away from a Regional TB Centre (AOR=14.33, 95% CI=1.91-107.64) and poor awareness (AOR=4.62, 95% CI=1.56-13.67) were independent predictors of long treatment delay.ConclusionsStrengthening comprehensive health education, enhancing treatment adherence counseling, providing more Xpert MTB/RIF machines, expanding decentralized MDR-TB treatment centers, ensuring timely sputum transportation, provision of a patient support package immediately after confirmation, and strengthening contact-tracing for all household contacts with MDR-TB patients and active tuberculosis screening were the most effective ways to shorten delays in MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment initiation.","Htun, Ye Minn Khaing, Tin Mi Mi Yin, Yin Myint, Zaw Aung, Si Thu Hlaing, Tin Maung Soonthornworasiri, Ngamphol Silachamroon, Udomsak Kasetjaroen, Yuthichai Kaewkungwal, Jaranit",878,"Htun, YM Khaing, TMM Yin, Y Myint, Z Aung, ST Hlaing, TM Soonthornworasiri, N Silachamroon, U Kasetjaroen, Y Kaewkungwal, J",,"[Htun, Ye Minn; Soonthornworasiri, Ngamphol; Kaewkungwal, Jaranit] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Dept Trop Hyg, Bangkok, Thailand.

"Contribution: There is a significant decline in technological vocations despite a huge increase in labor demand for professionals in these sectors. This technology-related problem has become a major concern for governments, organizations, and education systems. Students' motivation toward Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) may be due to the influence of their immediate environment, known role models and the involvement of families and teachers, as well as the search for more positive and inclusive perceptions of science and technology in our lives. The present study shows the perception and motivation of secondary students and teachers toward STEM and its importance in society. Background: The low presence of students in STEM could be explained by the perception and knowledge of students and teachers toward technology. Studies show that students largely lose interest in STEM during secondary school education, and this leads to a decline in technological vocations that carries over to university and the labor market. Due to the economic and social impact of this loss, institutions are launching initiatives to support education and the development of digital competences, with special emphasis on the awakening technological vocations. Research Questions: What is the motivation and perspective of students for STEM studies? Are teachers aware of students' perceptions? What are the actions taken by teachers to encourage secondary students toward STEM? Methodology: This study follows a descriptive correlational design based on surveys (1562 students and 430 teachers) regarding issues that influence the perceptions of students and teachers toward STEM. Findings: This study demonstrates a divergence between teachers' and students' perceptions of STEM-related skills and abilities. Indeed, teachers and parents/guardians need to encourage more young people to engage in STEM activities because of the great influence they have on their decisions. The search for new STEM referents that young people can identify with is another important finding. Furthermore, this study also reveals that technology should be linked to our daily lives and emphasize its role as a social good for society. Finally, integrating STEM subjects into the curriculum and encouraging technological vocations at all stages of education are of utmost importance.","Ayuso, Alba Merayo, Noemi Ruiz, Ines Fernandez, Patricia",,"Ayuso, A Merayo, N Ruiz, I Fernández, P",713,"[Ayuso, Alba] Univ Valladolid, Dept Pedag, Fac Med, Valladolid 47005, Spain.

"BackgroundNumerous studies show that active and engaging classrooms help students learn and persist in college, but adoption of new teaching practices has been slow. Professional development programs encourage instructors to implement new teaching methods and change the status quo in STEM undergraduate teaching, and structured observations of classrooms can be used in multiple ways to describe and assess this instruction. We addressed the challenge of measuring instructional change with observational protocols, data that often do not lend themselves easily to statistical comparisons. Challenges using observational data in comparative research designs include lack of descriptive utility for holistic measures and problems related to construct representation, non-normal distributions and Type-I error inflation for segmented measures.ResultsWe grouped 790 mathematics classes from 74 instructors using Latent Profile Analysis (a statistical clustering technique) and found four reliable categories of classes. Based on this grouping we proposed a simple proportional measure we called Proportion Non-Didactic Lecture (PND). The measure aggregated the proportions of interactive to lecture classes for each instructor. We tested the PND and a measure derived from the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) with data from a professional development study. The PND worked in simple hypothesis tests but lacked some statistical power due to possible ceiling effects. However, the PND provided effective descriptions of changes in instructional approaches from pre to post. In tandem with examining the proportional measure, we also examined the RTOP-Sum, an existing outcome measure used in comparison studies. The measure is based on the aggregated items in a holistic observational protocol. As an aggregate measure we found it to be highly reliable, correlated highly with the PND, and had more statistical power than the PND. However, the RTOP measure did not provide the thick descriptions of teaching afforded by the PND.ConclusionsFindings suggest that useful dependent measures can be derived from both segmented and holistic observational measures. Both have strengths and weaknesses: measures from segmented data are best at describing changes in teaching, while measures derived from the RTOP have more statistical power. Determining the validity of these measures is important for future use of observational data in comparative studies.","Weston, Timothy J. Laursen, Sandra L.

"Background The analogy of the leaky pipeline has been used to describe STEM education, with lower student diversity from compulsory to post-compulsory education and beyond. Although extensive research has explored the views and experiences of school-aged children about STEM, fewer studies have examined the career intentions of STEM students at university, especially those from under-represented backgrounds (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, women and working class students). This paper draws on a large qualitative study that interviewed 110 under-represented STEM undergraduates in the UK. We focus on students' STEM career intentions and the likely directions of their post-degree trajectories, drawing on the lenses of science identity and Social Cognitive Career Theory. Results Three pathways were identified. The first group plans to pursue a career in or from STEM. While social inequalities may persist, the potential impact of these challenges may be neutralised by the personal drive and passion of STEM career-oriented students, who seem committed to drive into an STEM future. The second group stated intentions for non-STEM-related careers, leaving the STEM pipeline. The reasons students gave for their imminent departure from STEM are the better financial reward on offer in some non-STEM sectors, especially in finance and business, as well as wider social inequalities and stereotypes. The third group was undecided, those who are uncertain or unclear about their futures. Students described a general lack of direction or clear career pathway, from a complete lack of career ideas to an overload of options. Conclusions We conclude with a reminder that the STEM pipeline is far from secured or equitable, despite apparent progress in participation and representation. We reiterate the importance of fostering a diverse, inclusive and supportive learning environment that maximises the participation, strengths and potential of all students, especially those from under-represented backgrounds. While it is not uncommon for STEM students to pursue careers outside of STEM, we need to be wary that those who exit the STEM pipeline are not forced off the road by social inequalities and exclusions.","Wong, Billy Chiu, Yuan-Li Tiffany Murray, Orla Meadhbh Horsburgh, Jo",51,"Wong, B Chiu, YLT Murray, OM Horsburgh, J",,"[Wong, Billy] Univ Reading, Reading RG1 5EX, Berks, England.

"Background Unplugged programming is proved to be an effective means to foster the learner-centered programming learning. In addition to the final tests, learners' programming knowledge, skills, and capacities are primarily demonstrated throughout the programming process, particularly in the situation when they encounter challenges and problems. However, few studies examine how learners engage in the programming processes and to what extent unplugged programming fosters learning. This research used a quasi-experimental design to investigate two instructional modes in China's secondary education, namely, the instructor-directed lecturing and the learner-centered unplugged programming. Based on an analytical framework, this research used mixed methods to compare learners' knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under these two instructional modes. Results The research results revealed discrepancies between two instructional modes. First, learners in the unplugged programming class achieved significantly higher scores on the programming knowledge assessment, compared to learners in the traditional lecturing class. Second, compared to the traditional lecturing class, learners in the unplugged programming class had higher test scores of the computational thinking skills, particularly on the cooperativity dimension. Next, discrepancies of in-class behaviors showed that learners in the unplugged programming class had frequent behaviors of listening to the instructor's instructions and discussing with peers, while learners in the instructor-directed class had frequent behaviors of listening to instructor, taking notes, and irrelevant activities. Learners' self-reported attitudes in the unplugged programming indicated a higher level of confidence than learners in the traditional lecturing class. Overall, this research revealed that the learner-centered unplugged programming had potential to improve learners' programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes compared to the traditional instructor-directed lecturing of programming. Conclusions As a feasible and easy-to-use instructional activity in computer science education, unplugged programming is encouraged to be integrated in formal education to increase learners' programming interests, motivations, and qualities. This quasi-experimental research compared learners' programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under two instructional modes. The results revealed critical discrepancies between two instructional modes on learners' knowledge gains, in-class behaviors, and changes of attitudes towards programming. Pedagogical and analytical implications were provided for future instructional design and learning analytics of computer programming education.","Sun, Dan Ouyang, Fan Li, Yan Zhu, Caifeng",54,"Sun, D Ouyang, F Li, Y Zhu, CF",,"[Sun, Dan; Ouyang, Fan; Li, Yan] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Educ, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

"Introduction Universities across the United States have implemented initiatives to enhance diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, focusing on improving outcomes for racially minoritized students. While many diversity initiatives target undergraduate programs, there is a gap in support for STEM graduate students. Recognizing the persistent underrepresentation of racially diverse populations in STEM, the Biden-Harris Administration launched the ""Raise the Bar: STEM Excellence for All Students"" initiative, aiming to bolster STEM education nationwide. Foundations like the Sloan Foundation have developed pathways programs for STEM students, extending support into graduate school and the professoriate. The success of diversity initiatives often hinges on the participation and endorsement of underrepresented STEM faculty.Methods This study investigates the perspectives of twenty-nine Black engineering and computing faculty regarding diversity initiatives within their respective departments. Grounded theory methodology guided the qualitative analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of the racialized diversity management framework. Drawing on institutional racism perspectives, the study aimed to develop a theoretical framework elucidating institutional engagement with and implementation of diversity initiatives in engineering education.Results The participants' perspectives on diversity initiatives reflected features of organizational change. Three types of organizational environments emerged: 1) stagnant, characterized by aspirational commitments to diversity; 2) moderate, where underrepresented populations are recruited but expected to assimilate into the dominant culture; and 3) transformational, representing organizations taking significant steps towards creating equitable environments. The narratives of the study participants shed light on the varying effectiveness of efforts to increase the representation of successful Black students and faculty in engineering academia.Discussion The findings underscore the importance of understanding organizational contexts and dynamics in shaping the outcomes of diversity initiatives. By delineating the racialized diversity management framework, this study provides insights into the complexities of institutional engagement with diversity in engineering education. Addressing the challenges identified, particularly in environments characterized as stagnant or moderate, is crucial for advancing equity and inclusion in STEM fields. Effective diversity initiatives must go beyond recruitment efforts to create transformative, equitable environments conducive to the success of racially minoritized students and faculty in engineering academia.","Miles, Monica L.

"Background: Students from Bangladesh pursuing STEM education often encounter obstacles when tackling diverse mathematical problems within various educational settings. Frequently, they find themselves lacking the essential prerequisite knowledge and strong foundational skills necessary to engage with the teaching and learning resources utilized at the undergraduate level, resulting in a significant number of students needing to seek readmission annually. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the determinants of academic achievement among university undergraduates majoring in mathematics in Bangladesh. Employing a mixedmethod research approach, the study combines quantitative and qualitative data analysis to examine the viewpoints of both students and educators concerning these factors. The authors primarily emphasize classifying the factors that impact the efficacy of mathematics pedagogical methods. Methodology: The study is structured into three phases: i. An initial exploratory qualitative survey. ii. A quantitative triangulation survey. iii. Followed by explanatory semi-structured interviews. Findings: To begin, the initial qualitative survey identified significant factors that contribute to students' achievements and setbacks in mathematics. Subsequently, the quantitative analysis verified both similarities and distinctions in the perspectives of students and educators. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient analysis revealed that male students frequently exhibit inconsistency and a lack of enthusiasm for studying, resulting in subpar performance. Conversely, female students frequently cited challenges like the difficulty of connecting mathematical theories to real-world applications, heavy course loads, and limited resources as reasons for their academic difficulties. Lastly, insights from interviews with students highlighted their acknowledgment of inadequate study practices, excessive reliance on memorization, suboptimal teaching methods, low motivation, and external distractions as key factors leading to their struggles. They also recognized the importance of consistent practice, a solid comprehension of concepts, regular study routines, and effective learning strategies for successful mathematics education. In contrast, educators emphasized the significance of students having clear concepts, natural aptitude, motivation, and a sense of curiosity as pivotal elements for successful learning in mathematics. Conclusion: This conclusion suggests a new beginning in the realm of local mathematics pedagogy, achieved by scrutinizing teacher-student feedback about the factors influencing success and failure, considering the diverse individual and contextual variables at play. To foster mutual trust and understanding between students and teachers, it may be beneficial to engage in open discussions and interactions.","Saha, Mili Islam, Shobha Akhi, Asma Akter Saha, Goutam",e29173,"Saha, M Islam, S Akhi, AA Saha, G",,"[Saha, Mili] Jagannath Univ, Dept English, Dhaka 1100, Bangladesh.

"Background: To improve the overall impact (reach X efficacy) of cessation treatments and to reduce the population prevalence of smoking, innovative strategies are needed that increase consumer demand for and use of cessation treatments. Given that 12 million people search for smoking cessation information each year, online advertising may represent a cost-efficient approach to reach and recruit online smokers to treatment. Online ads can be implemented in many forms, and surveys consistently show that consumers are receptive. Few studies have examined the potential of online advertising to recruit smokers to cessation treatments. Objective: The aims of the study were to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of online advertising as a strategy to increase consumer demand for cessation treatments, (2) illustrate the tools that can be used to track and evaluate the impact of online advertising on treatment utilization, and (3) highlight some of the methodological challenges and future directions for researchers. Methods: An observational design was used to examine the impact of online advertising compared to traditional recruitment approaches (billboards, television and radio ads, outdoor advertising, direct mail, and physician detailing) on several dependent variables: (1) number of individuals who enrolled in Web- or telephone-based cessation treatment, (2) the demographic, smoking, and treatment utilization characteristics of smokers recruited to treatment, and (3) the cost to enroll smokers. Several creative approaches to online ads (banner ads, paid search) were tested on national and local websites and search engines. The comparison group was comprised of individuals who registered for Web-based cessation treatment in response to traditional advertising during the,same time period. Results: A total of 130,214 individuals responded to advertising during the study period: 23,923 (18.4%) responded to traditional recruitment approaches and 106,291 (81.6%) to online ads. Of those who clicked on an online ad, 9655 (9.1%) registered for cessation treatment: 6.8% (n = 7268) for Web only, 1.1% (n = 1119) for phone only, and 1.2% (n = 1268) for Web and phone. Compared to traditional recruitment approaches, online ads recruited a higher percentage of males, young adults, racial/ethnic minorities, those with a high school education or less, and dependent smokers. Cost-effectiveness analyses compare favorably to traditional recruitment strategies, with costs as low as US $5-$8 per enrolled smoker. Conclusions: Developing and evaluating new ways to increase consumer demand for evidence-based cessation services is critical to cost-efficiently reduce population smoking prevalence. Results suggest that online advertising is a promising approach to recruit smokers to Web- and telephone-based cessation interventions. The enrollment rate of 9.1% exceeds most studies of traditional recruitment approaches. The powerful targeting capabilities of online advertising present new opportunities to reach subgroups of smokers who may not respond to other forms of advertising. Online advertising also provides unique evaluation opportunities and challenges to determine rigorously its impact and value.","Graham, Amanda L. Milner, Pat Saul, Jessie E.

"IntroductionRacial and ethnic minority groups and individuals with limited educational attainment experience a disproportionate burden of diabetes. Prediabetes represents a high-risk state for developing type 2 diabetes, but most adults with prediabetes are unaware of having the condition. Uncovering whether racial, ethnic, or educational disparities also occur in the prediabetes stage could help inform strategies to support health equity in preventing type 2 diabetes and its complications. We examined the prevalence of prediabetes and prediabetes awareness, with corresponding prevalence ratios according to race, ethnicity, and educational attainment.MethodsThis study was a pooled cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2011 to March 2020. The final sample comprised 10,262 U.S. adults who self-reported being Asian, Black, Hispanic, or White. Prediabetes was defined using hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose values. Those with prediabetes were classified as ""aware"" or ""unaware"" based on survey responses. We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) to assess the relationship between race, ethnicity, and educational attainment with prediabetes and prediabetes awareness, controlling for sociodemographic, health and healthcare-related, and clinical characteristics.ResultsIn fully adjusted logistic regression models, Asian, Black, and Hispanic adults had a statistically significant higher risk of prediabetes than White adults (PR:1.26 [1.18,1.35], PR:1.17 [1.08,1.25], and PR:1.10 [1.02,1.19], respectively). Adults completing less than high school and high school had a significantly higher risk of prediabetes compared to those with a college degree (PR:1.14 [1.02,1.26] and PR:1.12 [1.01,1.23], respectively). We also found that Black and Hispanic adults had higher rates of prediabetes awareness in the fully adjusted model than White adults (PR:1.27 [1.07,1.50] and PR:1.33 [1.02,1.72], respectively). The rates of prediabetes awareness were consistently lower among those with less than a high school education relative to individuals who completed college (fully-adjusted model PR:0.66 [0.47,0.92]).DiscussionDisparities in prediabetes among racial and ethnic minority groups and adults with low educational attainment suggest challenges and opportunities for promoting health equity in high-risk groups and expanding awareness of prediabetes in the United States.","Formagini, Taynara Brooks, Joanna Veazey Roberts, Andrew Bullard, Kai McKeever Zhang, Yan Saelee, Ryan O'Brien, Matthew James",1277657,"Formagini, T Brooks, JV Roberts, A Bullard, KM Zhang, Y Saelee, R O'Brien, MJ",,"[Formagini, Taynara] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Family Med & Publ Hlth, San Diego, CA 92093 USA.

"Background Patients with a severe acute brain injury admitted to the intensive care unit often have a poor neurological prognosis. In these situations, a clinician is responsible for conducting a goals-of-care conversation with the patient's surrogate decision makers. The diversity in thought and background of surrogate decision makers can present challenges during these conversations. For this reason, our study aimed to identify predictive characteristics of US surrogate decision makers' favoring life-sustaining treatment (LST) over comfort measures only for patients with severe acute brain injury. Methods We analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey study that had recruited 1588 subjects from an online probability-based US population sample. Seven hundred and ninety-two subjects had randomly received a hypothetical scenario regarding a relative intubated with severe acute brain injury with a prognosis of severe disability but with the potential to regain some consciousness. Seven hundred and ninety-six subjects had been randomized to a similar scenario in which the relative was projected to remain vegetative. For each scenario, we conducted univariate analyses and binary logistic regressions to determine predictors of LST selection among available respondent characteristics. Results 15.0% of subjects selected LST for the severe disability scenario compared to 11.4% for the vegetative state scenario (p = 0.07), with those selecting LST in both groups expressing less decisional certainty. For the severe disability scenario, independent predictors of LST included having less than a high school education (adjusted OR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.23-6.76), concern regarding prognostic accuracy (7.64, 3.61-16.15), and concern regarding the cost of care (4.07, 1.80-9.18). For the vegetative scenario, predictors included the youngest age group (30-44 years, 3.33, 1.02-10.86), male gender (3.26, 1.75-6.06), English as a second language (2.94, 1.09-7.89), Evangelical Protestant (3.72, 1.28-10.84) and Catholic (4.01, 1.72-9.36) affiliations, and low income (< $25 K). Conclusion Several demographic and decisional characteristics of US surrogate decision makers predict LST selection for patients with severe brain injury with varying degrees of poor prognosis. Surrogates concerned about the cost of medical care may nevertheless be inclined to select LST, albeit with high levels of decisional uncertainty, for patients projected to have severe disabilities.","Garg, Anisha Soto, Alexandria L.

"Background Dementia and frailty often accompany one another in older age, requiring complex care and resources. Available projections provide little information on their joint impact on future health-care need from different segments of society and the associated costs. Using a newly developed microsimulation model, we forecast this situation in Japan as its population ages and decreases in size. Methods In this microsimulation modelling study, we built a model that simulates an individual's status transition across 11 chronic diseases (including diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke) as well as depression, functional status, and self-reported health, by age, sex, and educational strata (less than high school, high school, and college and higher), on the basis of nationally representative health surveys and existing cohort studies. Using the simulation results, we projected the prevalence of dementia and frailty, life expectancy with these conditions, and the economic cost for formal and informal care over the period 2016-43 in the population of japan aged 60 years and older. Findings Between 2016 and 2043, life expectancy at age 65 years will increase from 23.7 years to 24.9 years in women and from 18.7 years to 19.9 years in men. Years spent with dementia will decrease from 4.7 to 3.9 years in women and 2.2 to 1.4 years in men. By contrast, years spent with frailty will increase from 3.7 to 4.0 years for women and 1.9 to 2.1 for men, and across all educational groups. By 2043, approximately 2904 of women aged 75 years and older with a less than high school education are estimated to have both dementia and frailty, and so will require complex care. The expected need for health care and formal long-term care is anticipated to reach costs of US$125 billion for dementia and $97 billion for frailty per annum in 2043 for the country. Interpretation Japan's Government and policy makers should consider the potential social challenges in caring for a sizable population of older people with frailty and dementia, and a widening disparity in the burden of those conditions by sex and by educational status. The future burden of dementia and frailty should be countered not only by curative and preventive technology innovation, but also by social policies to mitigate the health gap.

"Siloed or singular system approach to disease management is common practice, developing out of traditional medical school education. Textbooks of medicine describe a huge number of discrete diseases, usually in a systematic fashion following headings like etiology, pathology, investigations, differential diagnoses, and management. This approach suggests that the body has a multitude of ways to respond to harmful incidences. However, physiology and systems biology provide evidence that there is a simple mechanism behind this phenotypical variability. Regardless if an injury or change was caused by trauma, infection, non-communicable disease, autoimmune disorders, or stress, the typical physiological response is: an increase in blood supply to the area, an increase in white cells into the affected tissue, an increase in phagocytic activity to remove the offending agent, followed by a down-regulation of these mechanisms resulting in healing. The cascade of inflammation is the body's unique mechanism to maintain its integrity in response to macroscopic as well as microscopic injuries. We hypothesize that chronic disease development and progression are linked to uncontrolled or dysfunctional inflammation to injuries regardless of their nature, physical, environmental, or psychological. Thus, we aim to reframe the prevailing approach of management of individual diseases into a more integrated systemic approach of treating the ""person as a whole,"" enhancing the patient experience, ability to a make necessary changes, and maximize overall health and well-being. The first part of the paper reviews the local immune cascades of pro-and anti-inflammatory regulation and the interconnected feedback loops with neural and psychological pathways. The second part emphasizes one of nature's principles at work-system design and efficiency. Continually overwhelming this finely tuned system will result in systemic inflammation allowing chronic diseases to emerge; the pathways of several common conditions are described in detail. The final part of the paper considers the implications of these understandings for clinical care and explore how this lens could shape the physician-patient encounter and health system redesign. We conclude that healthcare professionals must advocate for an anti-inflammatory lifestyle at the patient level as well as at the local and national levels to enhance population health and well-being.","Bennett, Jeanette M.

"BackgroundChronic osteomyelitis is a highly prevalent and severe orthopaedic complication, representing a critical unresolved issue. The clinical symptoms of osteomyelitis are influenced by various factors, including geography, lifestyle, and pre-existing medical conditions.This study aims to provide theoretical basis for treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis by investigating and analyzing clinical features and pathogen distribution among 282 patients with chronic tibial osteomyelitis in xinjiang.MethodsA total of 282 patients with chronic tibial osteomyelitis from January 1, 2012 to January 1, 2022 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. All data were collected from electronic medical record (EMR) system including demographics, etiology, risk factors, osteomyelitis location and clinical classification.ResultsFarmers, students, unemployed and retirees accounted for a relatively large proportion of the 282 patients. There were 233 males and 49 females with a gender ratio of 4.75:1. The average age was 40.21 +/- 15.68 years and was mainly concentrated in 41-50 years, specifically, the mean age of females was slightly older than that of males. Education level was mostly primary and secondary school education, and illiteracy. Risk factors of chronic tibial osteomyelitis included history of smoking and drinking, history of multiple repeated surgeries, and impaired immunity. Frequent clinical symptoms were in the order of pain, local swelling, pus discharge and skin ulceration. Among all inflammatory markers, proportion of positive results were 30.85%, 59.93% and 53.90% for white blood cell (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively. Positive rate of pathogenic microorganism culture was low and the three most common bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The most frequent site of infection was middle tibia. According to Cierny-Mader osteomyelitis classification, the most common types were type IIIA, IVA and IIA.ConclusionNumber of visits due to chronic osteomyelitis increased year by year, with young and middle-aged male farmers and low education level as the main groups. Smoking and drinking were two considerable risk factors that should be attached to a great importance. No significant increase was found in inflammatory markers and lower positive rate of pathogenic microorganism culture was observed. Multi-drug resistant bacteria were common and S. aureus remained the most frequent pathogen. Elevated ESR had certain diagnostic value for osteomyelitis. Type III and type IV osteomyelitis accounted for a large proportion which posed great challenges for clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Huang, Xiaoxia Li, Qian Chen, Jiahan Liu, Tao Zhao, Yan Teng, Yong",823,"Huang, XX Li, Q Chen, JH Liu, T Zhao, Y Teng, Y",,"[Huang, Xiaoxia] Xinjiang Med Univ, Grad Sch, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.

"Background Studies of autistic children suggest that restricted eating, reduced physical activity, and sleep disorders are common; however, no studies attempt to broadly describe the diet, exercise, and sleep patterns of autistic adults or consider relationships between lifestyle behaviors and the widely reported increased risks of obesity and chronic conditions. To address this, the authors developed the largest study of lifestyle patterns of autistic adults and assessed their relationships to body mass index, health outcomes, and family history. Methods We administered an anonymized, online survey to n = 2386 adults (n = 1183 autistic) aged 16-90 years of age. We employed Fisher's exact tests and binomial logistic regression to describe diet, exercise, and sleep patterns; mediation of seizure disorders on sleep; body mass index (BMI); relationships of lifestyle factors to BMI, cardiovascular conditions, and diabetic conditions; and sex differences among autistic adults. Results Autistic adults, and particularly autistic females, exhibit unhealthy diet, exercise, and sleep patterns; they are also more likely to be underweight or obese. Limited sleep duration and high rates of sleep disturbances cannot be accounted for by epilepsy or seizure disorders. Lifestyle factors are positively related to higher risk of cardiovascular conditions among autistic males, even more than family history. Limitations Our sample may not be representative of all autistic and non-autistic people, as it primarily comprised individuals who are white, female, have a high school education or higher, and reside in the UK. Our sampling methods may also exclude some individuals on the autism spectrum, and particularly those with moderate to severe intellectual disability. This is a cross-sectional sample that can test for relationships between factors (e.g., lifestyle factors and health outcomes) but cannot assess the direction of these relationships. Conclusions Autistic adults are less likely to meet minimal health recommendations for diet, exercise, and sleep-and these unhealthy behaviors may relate to excess risk of cardiovascular conditions. Although the present study can only provide preliminary, correlational evidence, our findings suggest that diet, exercise, and sleep should be considered and further investigated as key targets for reducing the now widely reported and dramatically increased risks of health comorbidity and premature death among autistic individuals compared to others. Physicians should work cooperatively with patients to provide health education and develop individualized strategies for how to better manage challenges with diet, exercise, and sleep.","Weir, Elizabeth Allison, Carrie Ong, Ken K.

"Context: Educational reform efforts have taken the form of different school models intended to reduce educational inequality. Personalized, interest-based schools and academically focused, ""No Excuses"" schools are two leading small-school designs with sharply contrasting approaches to innovation. Given mixed research findings about the successes and challenges of school reform models in the United States, it is imperative to understand how educational outcomes of students relate to the philosophy and distinguishing characteristics of particular school models such as these. At the same time, evaluating social mobility effects of high school education across educational reform models requires examination of common metrics such as high school graduation rate and college entrance and degree attainment. Purpose: This study sought to establish whether and how a personalized, interest-based secondary school reform model is associated with graduates' characteristics and postsecondary outcomes-and to place these findings in relation to student outcomes reported by a leading No Excuses school network. Setting: Big Picture Learning is a network of innovative small schools that serves primarily low-income and minoritized students through an individualized, relational, real-world-based high school experience. The Big Picture educational model features individualized learning plans connected to extensive internships, independent learning organized around student interests, authentic assessments, and close, informal relationships between students and adults. Research Design: The Big Picture Longitudinal Study tracked 1900 graduates from six graduating high school classes. Data sources included student and school advisor surveys, National Student Clearinghouse college enrollment data, and interviews with graduates' former advisors. Published outcomes data for KIPP No Excuses schools provided comparative information. Analyses comprised descriptive statistics of survey data and multivariate regression analyses connecting high school exit data to college outcomes. Findings: The Big Picture Learning model is extremely successful in meeting its stated goals of fostering positive relationships, helping students discover and pursue their interests, and promoting high school graduation and college entrance. Results for academic subject achievement and college persistence are mixed, however. Big Picture graduates have similar college matriculation rates but somewhat lower six-year graduation rates than alumni from the KIPP No Excuses school network. Alumni from both networks show high rates of college attrition. Conclusion: When taken alone and in context of other innovative school models, the Big Picture results point to the difficulty of sustaining secondary school gains in the post-high school lives of low-income students and highlight shortcomings of traditional colleges in serving this population.","Arnold, Karen Mihut, Georgiana",080303,"Arnold, K Mihut, G",,"[Arnold, Karen] Boston Coll, Higher Educ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.

"With the global migrant population on the rise, it's imperative to focus on the health status of more vulnerable groups within these communities. The elderly immigrants face myriad physical and psychosocial challenges that significantly impact their health and quality of life. This study aims to investigate the nutrition, daily life activities, and clinical frailty status of elderly immigrants residing in T & uuml;rkiye. A cross-sectional design was employed in the Sultanbeyli District, focusing on Syrian immigrants aged 65 and over. Participants were surveyed face-to-face by interpreters proficient in Arabic. The questionnaire comprised sociodemographic details, health status, and scales like Katz Daily Life Activities, Clinical Frailty, and Mini Nutritional Assessment. The data analysis was executed using SPSS 22. Continuous variables were presented as mean +/- standard deviation (SD) and median, while categorical ones were expressed in numbers and percentages (%). A significance level of P < .05 was considered for the analyses. The average age of the participants was determined as 71.64 +/- 6.20 years. In the study group, 49.7% were female, 75.5% were younger than 75 years old, 47.7% had less than primary school education, 56.3% were married, 42.4% had a low income level, and 56.9% lived in the same household with 5 or more people. Among the participants in the study group, 47% had walking and balance problems, 29.1% had a history of falls in the last year, 10.6% were disabled, 69.5% complained of pain, 82.8% had a chronic illness, and 43% had polypharmacy. The median value of the KATZ Daily Living Activities scale was 6, the mean score of the Clinical Frailty Score scale was 3.25 +/- 1.25, and the mean score of the Mini Nutritional Assessment scale was 12.40 +/- 2.15. Among immigrant elderly individuals, 88.1% were able to sustain their lives independently, 13.9% were clinically frail, and 3.3% were at risk of malnutrition. Factors such as age, level of education, socioeconomic status, marital status, number of cohabitants in the household, BMI, neurological problems, walking-balance disorders, disability, and presence of chronic diseases are associated with daily life activities, frailty, and malnutrition status. It is believed that broader field research with greater participation would be beneficial for evaluating the nutritional status of immigrant elderly individuals.","Deger, Mehmet Sait Sezerol, Mehmet Akif Atak, Muhammed",e37729,"Deger, MS Sezerol, MA Atak, M",,"[Deger, Mehmet Sait] Hitit Univ, Fac Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Corum, Turkiye.

"Background: Although comprehensive lifestyle habits are crucial for healthy aging, their adherence tends to decline as individuals grow older. Sustaining a healthy life over time poses a motivational challenge. Some digital tools, such as smartphone apps aimed at promoting healthy habits, have been used to counteract this decline. However, a more profound investigation is necessary into the diverse experiences of users, particularly when it concerns older adults or those who are unfamiliar with information and communications technologies. Objective: We aimed to develop a mobile app focused on promoting the health of older adults based on the principles of software engineering and a user -centered design. The project respected all ethical guidelines and involved the participation of older adults at various stages of the development of the app. Methods: This study used a mixed methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative methodologies for data collection. The study was conducted in Ribeir & atilde;o Pr & ecirc;to, S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, and involved 20 older adults of both genders who were aged >= 60 years and enrolled in the Physical Education Program for the Elderly at the University of S & atilde;o Paulo. The research unfolded in multiple phases, encompassing the development and refinement of the app with active engagement from the participants. Results: A total of 20 participants used a mobile health app with an average age of 64.8 (SD 2.7) years. Most participants had a high school education, middle-class status, and varying health literacy (mean score 73.55, SD 26.70). Overall, 90% (18/20) of the participants owned smartphones. However, 20% (4/20) of the participants faced installation challenges and 30% (6/20) struggled with web -based searches. The focus groups assessed app usability and satisfaction. Adjustments increased satisfaction scores significantly (Suitability Assessment of Materials: 34.89% to 70.65%; System Usability Scale: 71.23 to 87.14). Participant feedback emphasized font size, navigation, visual feedback, and personalization, and suggestions included health device integration, social interaction, and in -app communication support. Conclusions: This study contributes to the development of health care technologies tailored to the older adult population, considering their specific needs. It is anticipated that the resulting app will serve as a valuable tool for promoting healthy habits and enhancing the quality of life for older adults.","Sobrinho, Andressa Crystine da Silva Gomes, Grace Angelica de Oliveira Bueno Junior, Carlos Roberto",e54214,"Sobrinho, ACD Gomes, GAD Bueno, CR Jr",,"[Sobrinho, Andressa Crystine da Silva; Bueno Junior, Carlos Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Bandeirantes Ave 9000, BR-14055230 Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.

"This paper presents and analyses solutions where open education and open science were utilised to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education. The COVID-19 outbreak and associated lockdowns created huge challenges in school and higher education, demanding sudden responses which aimed to sustain pedagogical quality. Responses have varied from conservative to radically innovative. Universally, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and shocked societies worldwide, and education systems were on the front line. The lockdowns largely stopped face-to-face and formal education in almost all countries, and in most cases, distance learning soon became the 'new normal'. A central challenge concerned sustaining educational visions and ideals in such circumstances. To better understand the state of the art in the educational landscape, we collected case studies from 13 countries during the first year of the pandemic starting on 11 March 2020 (when the World Health Organization declared a pandemic). This paper presents summaries of the full country reports that were collected and describe lessons learned. Our overall aim was to identify good practices and recommendations from the collected case studies that can be taken forward in the future. We categorised the responses on the three generic educational levels (macro, meso and micro) and identified seven key aspects and trends that are valid for all or most countries: (1) formal education at a distance for first time; (2) similar approaches for formal education; (3) missing infrastructure and sharing open educational resources; (4) diverse teaching and learning methods and practices; (5) open education and access to open educational resources; (6) urgent need for professional development and training for teachers and (7) assessing and monitoring learning environments, teachers and students. Finally, we identified key recommendations on how open education and open science can benefit formal education in schools and universities in the future, namely, improved awareness of open educational practices, provision of ICT infrastructure, embracing and sustaining the practice of open access publications and OERs, capacity building for stakeholders and finally encouraging research and development in the area of open education and open science. We found significant evidence for the proposition that open education and open science can support both traditional face-to-face and distance learning.","Stracke, Christian M.

"BackgroundAmerican Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations have been disproportionately affected by chronic respiratory diseases for reasons incompletely understood. Past research into disease disparity using population-based surveys mostly focused on state-specific factors. The present study investigates the independent contributions of AI/AN racial status and other socioeconomic/demographic variables to chronic respiratory disease disparity in an 11-state region with historically high AI/AN representation. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) spanning years 2011-2018, this work provides an updated assessment of disease disparity and potential determinants of respiratory health in AI/AN populations.MethodsThis cross-sectional study used data from the BRFSS survey, 2011-2018. The study population included AI/AN and non-Hispanic white individuals resident in 11 states with increased proportion of AI/AN individuals. The yearly number of respondents averaged 75,029 (62878-87,350) which included approximately 5% AI/AN respondents (4.5-6.3%). We compared the yearly adjusted prevalence for chronic respiratory disease, where disease status was defined by self-reported history of having asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine if being AI/AN was independently associated with chronic respiratory disease. Covariates included demographic (age, sex), socioeconomic (marital status, education level, annual household income), and behavioral (smoking, weight morbidity) variables.ResultsThe AI/AN population consistently displayed higher adjusted prevalence of chronic respiratory disease compared to the non-Hispanic white population. However, the AI/AN race/ethnicity characteristic was not independently associated with chronic respiratory disease (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.10 in 2017). In contrast, indicators of low socioeconomic status such as annual household income of <$10,000 (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.64-2.49 in 2017) and having less than high school education (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.16-1.63 in 2017) were positively associated with disease. These trends persisted for all years analyzed.ConclusionsThis study highlighted that AI/AN socioeconomic burdens are key determinants of chronic respiratory disease, in addition to well-established risk factors such as smoking and weight morbidity. Disease disparity experienced by the AI/AN population is therefore likely a symptom of disproportionate socioeconomic challenges they face. Further promotion of public health and social service efforts may be able to improve AI/AN health and decrease this disease disparity.","Laffey, Kimberly G. Nelson, Alfreda D. Laffey, Matthew J.

"Background/Context: Calls to increase participation in and access to STEM education have been loud and frequent. These democratizing efforts have targeted the aspirations and expectations of non-dominant students attending U.S. secondary schools, promising pathways to college and opportunities for social mobility, yet the results have been mixed. While some exemplars exist, recent research has identified a number of social and structural challenges that undermine the stated goals of policy initiatives and fail to yield positive student outcomes. Purpose: Drawing upon the authors' notion of shadow capital, an extension of Bourdieu's theoretical framework, and Holland, Lachincotte, Skinner, and Cain's theory of figured worlds, this article explores how high-achieving students from non-dominant backgrounds construct their academic identities amid limited STEM material and discursive structures in two urban, non-selective, public, STEM-focused schools. In so doing we aim to extend and complicate the literature on STEM reform and its ability to provide opportunity and improve outcomes for non-dominant students. Research Design: The findings reported herein are part of a larger ethnographic, longitudinal, and comparative study of eight non-selective, urban public high schools serving primarily economically and racially non-dominant students. Data consist of interviews with multiple stakeholders, sustained participant and non-participant observation, and document analysis. In this article we focus on two STEM-focused schools, STEM Academy and Broadway Science Academy (BSA), and primarily draw upon interview data given our emphasis on student identity development. Findings/Results: As a result of a mismatch between the intention and outcome of STEM reform as it plays out in this study, each school provided students with shadow capital. Given the different school contexts, the effects of this shadow capital on students' STEM identities vary across site. In the case of STEM Academy, students develop conflicted STEM identities amid the school's own conflicted institutional identity as both STEM-focused and college preparatory. In the case of BSA, students are provided opportunities that are seen as more ""connected"" to student-lived experiences, resulting in vocational pathways devoid of the elements that truly bridge home and school in ways that create opportunity, complicating students' ability to actualize their college and career aspirations. Conclusions/Recommendations: In order to create authentic and meaningful connected STEM opportunities that allow students to draw from their own stores of capital and nurture STEM identities, we need to reevaluate and re-envision the ""good intentions"" undergirding the democratization of education and ask whether efforts to democratize STEM are plausible within our deeply stratified system.","Cipollone, Kristin Stich, Amy E.

"We evaluated the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism on Underrepresented Minority (URM) students pursuing higher education in the STEM fields. Given the ongoing pandemic and the wave of protests in response to a series of police brutalities and systemic racism, URM students were thrown into uncharted territory. We reached out to a group of Black and Latino students who were already engaged in STEM. We began surveys and interviews by asking participants how they were and how their family and communities were doing. Next, participants answered questions about academic progress, challenges, and what support would be helpful. Our framework was based on a mixed-methods approach that draws on the work of Michael Patton (Qualitative Research & Evaluation Methods: Integrating Theory and Practice, 2014) and Veronica Thomas (American Journal of Evaluation, 2016, 38 (1), 7-28). Qualitative data from interviews were collected to capture perceptions, experiences, and recommendations of the study participants. Survey data were collected to reach as many students as possible and to provide numerical self-assessments of student experience, progression, and obstacles. All qualitative data were coded thematically using Atlas. ti, with the goal of illuminating emerging themes, and quantitative data were reviewed using descriptive statistics. Themes emerging from both data sets were compared, contrasted, and integrated in order to develop consistent findings that would enhance URM student perseverance and persistence in the face of confounding adversities. This study shows that ILSAMP COVID-19 Study participants maintained a commitment to pursuing a career in STEM. The findings of this study also indicate that the participants are stressed by their immediate circumstances and by the ongoing racism of U.S. society. These students ask for additional financial, academic, and networking support during the disruptions caused by the pandemic. More specifically, students request continued advising and connection with STEM professionals who can help them envision and enact a pathway to their own careers in STEM during this tumultuous period. The study validates the importance of key elements of the national LSAMP model as reported by Clewell et al. (Revitalizing the Nation's Talent Pool in STEM, 2006). These are: academic integration, social integration, and professional integration. In addition, it identifies several other factors that are key to student success, including interventions that directly address racial trauma and economic hardship.","Botanga, Christopher Blanc, Suzanne Jones, LeRoy, II Day, Michelle Charles, Mariel",681027,"Botanga, C Blanc, S Jones, L Day, M Charles, M",,"[Botanga, Christopher; Jones, LeRoy, II] Chicago State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60628 USA.

"BackgroundIn medicine, critical thinking is required for managing and tolerating medical uncertainty, as well as solving professional problems and treating diseases. However, the core of Confucianism, teacher-centered and exam-oriented settings in middle and high school education may pose challenges to developing critical thinking in Han Chinese or Taiwanese students. Students may be adversely affected by these pedagogies since student-centered settings were more effective in stimulating their critical and reflective thinking, as well as a sense of responsibility, in the ever-changing world. Therefore, guiding students with less stable foundations of critical thinking might require a different approach. A review article highlighted the potential utility of the Socratic method as a tool for teaching critical thinking in the healthcare field. The method involves posing a series of questions to students. More importantly, medical students and residents in clinical teaching are familiar with the method. Almost all healthcare students must complete a biochemistry laboratory course as part of their basic science training. Thus, we aimed to train students to develop critical thinking in the biochemistry laboratory course by using learning sheets and teacher guidance based on the Socratic method and questioning.MethodWe recruited second-year students from a medical school, of whom 32 had medical science and biotechnology majors (MSB), 27 had pharmaceutical science majors (PS), and 85 were medical undergraduate (MU) students. An exercise in critical thinking was conducted during a biochemistry laboratory course, which consisted of five different biochemical experiments, along with learning sheets that contained three or four critical thinking questions. Then, the teacher evaluated the students' ability to think critically based on nine intellectual dimensions (clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, logic, fairness, and significance) based on the universal intellectual standards developed by Prof. Linda Elder and Richard Paul. In the following analysis, regression models and multivariate analysis were used to determine how students improved over time, and trajectory analysis were carried out in order to observe the trends in students' critical thinking skills construction.ResultsClarity and logic dimensions were identified as the key elements to facilitate the development of critical thinking skills through learning sheets and teacher guidance in students across all three different healthcare majors. The results showed that metacognitive monitoring via Socratic questioning learning sheets have demonstrated potential encourage students to develop critical thinking skills in all dimensions. Another unique contribution of current study was present the heterogeneous learning patterns and progress trajectories of clarity and logic dimensions within classes.ConclusionUsing the Socratic learning model could effectively develop students' critical thinking skills so they can more effectively care for their patients.","Ho, Yueh-Ren Chen, Bao-Yu Li, Chien-Ming",173,"Ho, YR Chen, BY Li, CM",,"[Ho, Yueh-Ren] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Univ Rd 1, East Dist, Tainan 701, Taiwan.

"ImportanceSuicide rates in the US increased by 35.6% from 2001 to 2021. Given that most individuals die on their first attempt, earlier detection and intervention are crucial. Understanding modifiable risk factors is key to effective prevention strategies. ObjectiveTo identify distinct suicide profiles or classes, associated signs of suicidal intent, and patterns of modifiable risks for targeted prevention efforts. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cross-sectional study used data from the 2003-2020 National Violent Death Reporting System Restricted Access Database for 306 800 suicide decedents. Statistical analysis was performed from July 2022 to June 2023. ExposuresSuicide decedent profiles were determined using latent class analyses of available data on suicide circumstances, toxicology, and methods. Main Outcomes and MeasuresDisclosure of recent intent, suicide note presence, and known psychotropic usage. ResultsAmong 306 800 suicide decedents (mean [SD] age, 46.3 [18.4] years; 239 627 males [78.1%] and 67 108 females [21.9%]), 5 profiles or classes were identified. The largest class, class 4 (97 175 [31.7%]), predominantly faced physical health challenges, followed by polysubstance problems in class 5 (58 803 [19.2%]), and crisis, alcohol-related, and intimate partner problems in class 3 (55 367 [18.0%]), mental health problems (class 2, 53 928 [17.6%]), and comorbid mental health and substance use disorders (class 1, 41 527 [13.5%]). Class 4 had the lowest rates of disclosing suicidal intent (13 952 [14.4%]) and leaving a suicide note (24 351 [25.1%]). Adjusting for covariates, compared with class 1, class 4 had the highest odds of not disclosing suicide intent (odds ratio [OR], 2.58; 95% CI, 2.51-2.66) and not leaving a suicide note (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.41-1.49). Class 4 also had the lowest rates of all known psychiatric illnesses and psychotropic medications among all suicide profiles. Class 4 had more older adults (23 794 were aged 55-70 years [24.5%]; 20 100 aged >= 71 years [20.7%]), veterans (22 220 [22.9%]), widows (8633 [8.9%]), individuals with less than high school education (15 690 [16.1%]), and rural residents (23 966 [24.7%]). Conclusions and RelevanceThis study identified 5 distinct suicide profiles, highlighting a need for tailored prevention strategies. Improving the detection and treatment of coexisting mental health conditions, substance and alcohol use disorders, and physical illnesses is paramount. The implementation of means restriction strategies plays a vital role in reducing suicide risks across most of the profiles, reinforcing the need for a multifaceted approach to suicide prevention.","Xiao, Yunyu Bi, Kaiwen Yip, Paul Siu-Fai Cerel, Julie Brown, Timothy T.

"Background Despite the unequivocal benefits of vaccination, vaccine coverage has been falling in several countries in the past few years. Studies suggest that vaccine hesitancy is an increasingly significant phenomenon affecting adherence to vaccines. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, political views have emerged as an additional influencing factor for vaccine hesitancy.Methods In this ecologic study, we used information from publicly available databases to investigate the association between political ideology, depicted by the percentage of votes for the right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro in the presidential elections of 2018 and 2022, and COVID-19 vaccination in Brazilian municipalities. The primary endpoint was the COVID-19 vaccination index, calculated as the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered up to September 2022 divided by the number of inhabitants in each municipality. The analysis was conducted using Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression models adjusted for HDI, the percentage of male voters, the percentage of voters who were older than 50 years old, and the percentage of voters with a middle school education or less. In addition, we explored whether the effect of the percentage of Bolsonaro voters on the COVID-19 vaccination index was modified in different quartiles of HDI using an interaction term.Results Five thousand five hundred sixty-three Brazilian municipalities were included in the analysis. For both the 2018 and 2022 elections, the percentage of votes for Jair Bolsonaro was significantly and inversely associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake after adjustment for the sociodemographic characteristics of the voters (change in mean vaccination index in 2018 for each 1% increase in Bolsonaro voters-0.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]-0.13 to-0.08, p < 0.001; change in mean vaccination index in 2022 for each 1% increase in Bolsonaro voters-0.09, 95% CI-0.11 to-0.07, p < 0.001). We also found a statistically significant interaction between the primary predictor of interest and HDI scores, with a more significantly detrimental effect of the right-wing political stance in municipalities in the lower HDI quartiles (interaction p < 0.001 for the first HDI quartile; p = 0.001 for the second HDI quartile).Conclusion Our findings suggest that political ideologies have influenced COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Brazilian municipalities, affecting communities inequitably. The politicization of vaccines is a new challenge for vaccine programs. Strategies to face these challenges should include joint efforts from governments and civil society for a common public health goal.","Seara-Morais, Gabriel J. Avelino-Silva, Thiago J.

"Introduction To make valid comparisons across groups, a measurement instrument needs to be measurement invariant across those groups. The present study evaluates measurement invariance for experience of violence among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in two informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods We used survey data collected from 1,081 AGYW aged 15-22 years from two Nairobi's informal settlements of Korogocho (n = 617) and Viwandani (n = 464) in 2017 through DREAMS (an initiative aimed at reducing HIV incidence among AGYW with a core package of evidence-based interventions) impact evaluation project. Experience of violence was measured using the 15-item WHO's violence against women instrument, and factorial (non)invariance assessed within exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) framework. Cross-group measurement invariance was assessed using Bayesian Multiple Indicator Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model across site, age groups, self-reported invitation to participate in DREAMS, marital status, currently in school, education level, religion, ethnic groups, ever had sex, slept hungry at night past 4 weeks, and wealth index. Results The mean and median ages of the AGYW were 17.9 years and 17 years, respectively. About 59% reported having had sex and 58% of AGYW were in school. The percentage reporting each act of violence varied from 1.6% (""attacked you with a weapon"") to 26.5% (""insult you or make you feel bad about yourself""). About 44% (n = 474) of participants experienced >= 1 acts of violence, and 2.7% (n = 29) experienced at least half of the 15 acts. The structure underlying the 15 items was configurally similar to that proposed by WHO, with three factors reflecting either psychological, physical, or sexual violence. Noninvariance was detected for five items-spread across the three domains. Three of five items showed noninvariance only for sleeping hungry at night in the past 4 weeks. As the majority of items did not show evidence of noninvariance, differences in latent mean scores likely reflect actual differences and may not be attributable to measurement artifacts. Conclusions Using state-of-the-art statistical techniques on a widely used instrument for measuring exposure to violence among women, this study provides support for the subscales of psychological, physical and sexual violence in a Kenyan AGYW population. The instrument supports comparisons across groups within this population. This is crucial when comparing violence against girls/women prevalence rates and to understand challenges and exchange strategies to reduce abuse or violence experienced by AGYW, or women in general.","Orindi, Benedict O.

"Background: Although studies in China have found that school bullying is prevalent among adolescents, most relevant research has focused on southern China, while research in northern China is limited. This study aimed to explore ethnic disparities in the socio-demographic determinants of school bullying in Inner Mongolia, a northern region of China. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2891 adolescents in Inner Mongolia, China, from September to December 2022. Data on participants' sociodemographic characteristics and school bullying experiences were collected through questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, stratified by ethnicity, were employed to examine factors associated with school bullying. Furthermore, subgroup analyses and interaction tests were conducted to explore potential effect modifiers of the relationship between ethnicity and bullying. Results: The prevalence of school bullying was 18.99 % (549/2891) overall, with 17.96 % (420/ 2339) among Han and 23.37% (129/552) among ethnic minorities. Minority adolescents faced a higher risk of bullying compared to Han (OR OR = 1.35, 95 % CI : 1.08-1.69, P < 0.05). Middle school students were more vulnerable to bullying than high school students (OR OR = 1.25, 95% CI :1.03-1.52, P < 0.05). Among Han adolescents, having a mother with high school education was protective against bullying (OR OR = 0.71, 95 % CI : 0.54-0.93, P < 0.05), while it was an associated factor for minorities (OR OR = 2.06, 95%CI :1.23-3.46, P < 0.05). Good family economic status was an associated factor for bullying among Han (OR OR = 1.62, 95%CI: : 1.11-2.36, P < 0.05), but not among minorities. Belonging to other family structures (remarriage/foster family, inter- generational families, live with relatives and elders) was an associated factor for minorities (OR OR = 2.60, 95 % CI : 1.37-4.92, P < 0.05), but not for Han. Subgroup analyses revealed significant ethnic disparities in bullying experiences among middle school students, those from nuclear family, other family, and fair economic backgrounds (all P < 0.05). Interaction effects between ethnicity and these variables were not significant (all P > 0.05). Limitations: This cross-sectional study has limitations in establishing causal relationships between identified associated factors and school bullying. Conclusions: Ethnic minority adolescents in Inner Mongolia, China, especially middle school students, face a higher risk of school bullying than their Han peers. The differential impact of maternal education, family economic status, and family structure on bullying risk between Han and minority adolescents underscores the need for culturally sensitive, targeted interventions that consider the unique challenges faced by ethnic minority students.","Zhang, Xi Liu, Liqiong Zhou, Zihang Qi, Ming Chen, Ling",e37201,"Zhang, X Liu, LQ Zhou, ZH Qi, M Chen, L",,"[Zhang, Xi] Shihezi Univ, Humanities Res Inst, Med Coll, Shihezi 832002, Peoples R China.

"There is increasing interest in the use of serious games in STEM education. Interactive simulations and serious games can be used by students to explore systems where it would be impractical or unethical to perform real world studies or experiments. Simulations also have the capacity to reveal the internal workings of systems where these details are hidden in the real world. However, there is still much to be investigated about the best methods for using these games in the classroom so as to derive the maximum educational benefit. We report on an experiment to compare two different methods of using a serious game for teaching a complex concept in marine ecology, in a university setting: expert demonstration versus exploration-based learning. We created an online game based upon a mathematical simulation of fishery management, modelling how fish populations grow and shrink in the presence of stock removal through fishing. The player takes on the role of a fishery manager, who must set annual catch quotas, making these as high as possible to maximise profit, without exceeding sustainable limits and causing the stock to collapse. There are two versions of the game. The ""whitebox"" or ""teaching"" game gives the player full information about all model parameters and actual levels of stock in the ocean, something which is impossible to measure in reality. The ""black-box"" or ""testing"" game displays only the limited information that is available to fishery managers in the real world, and is used to test the player's understanding of how to use that information to solve the problem of estimating the optimal catch quota. Our study addresses the question of whether students are likely to learn better by freely exploring the teaching game themselves, or by viewing a demonstration of the game being played expertly by the lecturer. We conducted an experiment with two groups of students, one using free, self-directed exploration and the other viewing an expert demonstration. Both groups were then assessed using the black box testing game, and completed a questionnaire. Our results show a statistically significant benefit for expert demonstration over free exploration. Qualitative analysis of the responses to the questionnaire demonstrates that students saw benefits to both teaching approaches, and many would have preferred a combination of expert demonstration with exploration of the game. The research was carried out among a mix of undergraduate and taught postgraduate science students. Future research challenges include extending the current study to larger cohorts and exploring the potential effectiveness of serious games and interactive simulation-based teaching methods in a range of STEM subjects in both university and school settings.","Ameerbakhsh, Omair Maharaj, Savi Hussain, Amir McAdam, Bruce",,"Ameerbakhsh, O Maharaj, S Hussain, A McAdam, B",181,"[Ameerbakhsh, Omair; Maharaj, Savi; Hussain, Amir] Univ Stirling, Comp Sci & Math, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.

"In response to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper proposes an exam system for STEM students that effectively test higher-order thinking skills, such as the ability to apply, create, evaluate, and analyse. Higher education institutions (HEIs) must incorporate all three strands of democratic STEM pedagogy, namely student voice, shared and transformational authority, and STEM criticality, according to empathy interviews with educators. It is imperative that these strands are reflected in the assessments of students within HEIs. During the pandemic, it became evident that the lack of a suitable proctored online examination system impeded the accurate and fair evaluation of students. This circumstance was in stark contrast to the offline mode of examination, which permitted monitoring and control. Notably, many students struggled to answer questions requiring higher-order thinking, with responses frequently identical in unproctored online examinations or settings with insufficient proctoring mechanisms, especially in contexts with limited resources. Consequently, there is an urgent need to redesign the online proctored test system in accordance with STEM criticality and student voice. To address this need, this paper proposes the creation of OPERHOT, a proctored online exam system integrated with random questions requiring higher-order thinking. This system employs a timed assessment methodology and requires students to keep their cameras on throughout the examination. By implementing OPERHOT, a proper and secure online evaluation of students can be made possible. In addition, this system will strengthen the online education and assessment systems in HEIs, thereby promoting integrity and enhancing the learning experience. In addition, the adoption of OPERHOT will also improve the assessment process and contribute to the enhancement of online education and assessment in HEIs as a whole. This reimagined system will catalyse the development of a robust and inclusive learning environment that encourages students' voices and equips educators to foster the growth of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This perspective aims to address the pressing need for an updated and effective proctored assessment system in the online educational landscape while promoting STEM critical thinking and student voice. The OPERHOT platform is at the ideation stage, and once developed, it may be tested in a few HEIs. Based on the feedback from educators and other stakeholders, it can be further modified to make it more inclusive and accessible and can be offered to other HEIs for wider piloting. An online proctored examination system with integrated higher-order thinking skills questions for STEM students is proposed in this perspective.","Mitra, Arindam",fnad074,"Mitra, A",,"[Mitra, Arindam] Adamas Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, Kolkata 700126, India.

"On-line purchase is the sphere that is getting on significance in companies business operations. Contemporary business millieu is faced up to frequent changes. The market has its own challenges, and companies are making efforts to meet them on the best possible way. In recent years very important is need for on-line purchase use understanding in order to achieve competitive advantage in goods and services trade. For good business strategy building it is necessary to know factors that affect on-line shopping advancement and use relating existing knowledge. Influential factors on buyer's attitude about on-line purchase are noted. It is observed that customers unwillingly give their credit cards numbers, but are very interested in saving time while shopping, just as to have greater choice possibility, and thereby pay reduced prices for the same goods or service. Interesting field of this research is on-line purchase in Serbia and its object is useful information on substantial factors of on-line shopping gathered by presenting interviews and analysis results. The importance of the research is in acquiring knowledge about respondent categories tending to more positive view about on-line purchase and how person educated in informatics is influenced to recognize advantages of this way of buying. This knowledge are basic for essential business decision making. Polling carried out under research, included 974 respondent replies. It was executed by questionnaire distributed to e- mail respondent's addresses and the very questionnaire was previously appropriately designed for the following statistical analysis. The basic purpose of this research was, based on the analysis results, to point to statistically important influence of belonging to demographic category just as to question the impact of informatics technology using level on the respondent's stand about on-line shopping. Methods used for statistical analysis were: Multivariate Tests, Multivariate Analysis of Variance and Tests of Between-Subjects Effects. The points of view on relevant factors for on-line purchase improvement were introduced as the result of different level of respondent's computer literacy just as demographic categories interviewing. Male persons in their fifties and secondary-school education level who are e-banking services users have more affirmative attitude about money saving by using on-line purchase. Persons in their thirties and fifties consider that on-line shopping is time-saver and about security more definite viewpoint have males who are already using Internet 5-10 years and besides are e-banking services users. Internet Using Frequency didn't have significant influence at the standpoint on any of these questions. It was concluded that belonging to some of the others respondent's categories is statistically important to the attitude about money and time saving just as safety of the on-line purchase, which are notable factors for its improvement.","Radosav, Dragica Eremic, Zeljko",,"Radosav, D Eremic, Z",367,"[Radosav, Dragica; Eremic, Zeljko] Univ Novi Sad, Tech Fac Mihajlo Pupin, Novi Sad, Serbia.",University of Novi Sad,,,,,2025-01-19,on-line; shopping; security; privacy,,Article,,,zeljko.eremic@gmai.com,377,,,,620EZ,,2,TECH TECHNOL EDUC MA,Tech.

"Introduction Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) continues to be a significant global public health problem. Conventional serological markers play a pivotal role in diagnosing and prognosticating CHB, but atypical serological profiles deviating from established norms pose challenges. Methods A cohort of 35 CHB patients who did not receive an antiviral treatment with atypical serological markers was followed for five years (2017-2022). Demographics, serological parameters, and changes were documented. Serological parameters and serum viral loads (hepatitis B virus (HBV)-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels) were assayed at the central laboratory during their routine follow-ups. Three groups of atypical serological markers are defined: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) positivity; hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and anti-hepatitis B e-antigen (anti-HBe) positivity; and isolated core (anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc) immunoglobulin G (IgG)) positivity. Patients with concomitant HBsAg and anti-HBs were also stratified into seroreversion groups. Changes in serological markers and HBV-DNA levels across the study period were documented and evaluated at the end of the study period. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis test and IBM SPSS Statistics software for Windows, Version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results In a cohort of 35 patients with atypical hepatitis B serology, demographic analysis revealed that 51.4% (n=18) were female and 48.6% (n=17) were male, with a mean age of 45.7 years. Educational distribution showed that 45.7% (n=16) completed primary education, 22.8% (n=8) had a high school education, and 31.5% (n=11) held university degrees. Among these patients, 10 displayed the concurrent presence of HBsAg and anti-HBs, with 60% (n=6) being female. Serum HBV-DNA was detectable in all cases. After five years, 60% (n=6) exhibited seroconversion from HBsAg to anti-HBs, particularly notable in females (66.7%). These patients showed lower HBsAg titers and serum HBV-DNA levels (p = 0.048, p = 0.036). A subset of 15 patients demonstrated simultaneous HBeAg and anti-HBe positivity. The HBeAg seropositivity waned over time, with 40% (n=6) and 26.7% (n=4) females and males, respectively, retaining positivity by the fifth year. During this period, serum HBV-DNA levels decreased. The remaining five patients sustained HBeAg and anti-HBe positivity. Among 10 patients solely positive for anti-HBc IgG, three had concurrent HBV-DNA positivity. Strikingly, three patients with negative HBV-DNA developed anti-HBs positivity after five years. Conclusion The complexity of CHB infection demands a comprehensive understanding. Atypical serological profiles suggest distinct disease stages, immune response variations, and viral mutations. This study enhances comprehension of viral replication, immune responses, and disease progression, potentially guiding tailored therapeutic strategies.","Barkay, Orcun Erol, Serpil Senbayrak, Seniha",e44899,"Barkay, O Erol, S Senbayrak, S",,"[Barkay, Orcun] Erzincan Binali Yildirim Univ, Fac Med, Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Erzincan, Turkiye.

"Systemic health barriers, economic challenges, and lack of follow-up care exacerbate self-management of chronic diseases like diabetes among Hispanic agricultural workers. The primary objective of this pilot project was to determine the benefit of using community coaches to decrease A1C levels and increase diabetes knowledge among agricultural workers with diagnosed diabetes in the Texas Panhandle. A longitudinal study design with two phases was used to create, deliver, and evaluate a diabetes coaching program. Phase 1 was the development of the program and community coaches training (n = 4). In Phase 2, the coaches then delivered the program over 12 weeks to thirteen clients. Phase 1: All coaches were Hispanic females, 28.3 (SD 3.8) years of age, half had at most a high school education level and the other half had a vocational certification (n = 4). Mean DKQ-24 score was 54.2% (SD = 29.7) at baseline and 75.0% (SD = 31.4) after training (t (4) = 4.6, P < 0.05). We observed a very large difference between mean baseline and exit DKQ-24 scores relative to the pooled standard deviation, resulting in an effect size estimate of 0.59 indicative of a medium to large learning effect. Phase 2: Clients were Hispanic Spanish-speaking, predominantly female (55%), 44.4 (SD 6.8) years of age with at most a high school level of education (88.9%) and occupations varied from dairy farm worker (33.3%), meat processing worker (33.3%), and other agriculture or manufacturing position (33.3%). The mean SKILLD score was 40.0% (SD = 28.7) at baseline, increasing to 72.2% (SD = 25.4) at 12 weeks upon completion of the coaching program (t (9) = 2.956, P < 0.05). We observed a very large difference between mean baseline and exit SKILLD scores relative to the pooled standard deviation, resulting in an effect size estimate of 1.13 indicative of a large learning effect. The mean A1C levels at baseline screening was 8.3% (SD = 3.0) and 7.6% (SD = 3.0) at exit screening, representing a 0.7% decrease (p = 0.4730). No statistically significant differences were observed between depression (p = 0.786) or anxiety (p = 1.000) measures at baseline compared to exit. Training and coaching programs for hard-to-reach agricultural and meat processing workers must be culturally, linguistically, and literacy appropriate for both coaches and clients. The program must be feasible and sustainable, focus on empowering community members, capitalize on technological advances and persisting new-normals from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as dismantle common systemic barriers to health and understanding lived-experiences of agricultural working populations in rural regions.","Rodriguez, Anabel Chavez, Lus Wagner, Teresa Howe, Carol",,"Rodriguez, A Chavez, L Wagner, T Howe, C",841,"[Rodriguez, Anabel] Texas A&M Univ, Sch Publ Hlth Coll Stn, Environm & Occupat Hlth, 212 Adriance Lab Rd, 1266 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.

"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Limited health literacy has previously been associated with increased health care utilization, worse general health status and self-reported health, and increased mortality. Identifying and accommodating patients with limited health literacy may offer an avenue towards mitigating adverse health outcomes and reduce unnecessary health care expenditure. Due to the challenges associated with implementation of lengthy health literacy assessments, the Brief Health Literacy Screening Instrument was developed. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports on the accuracy of this screening questionnaire, with or without the inclusion of sociodemographic characteristics, when predicting limited health literacy in orthopaedic spine patients.PURPOSE: To evaluate the reliability and predictive accuracy of self-reported health literacy screening questions with and without the inclusion of sociodemographic variables in orthopaedic spine patients. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients seen at a tertiary urban academic hospital-based multi-surgeon OUTCOME MEASURES: Brief Health Literacy Screening Instrument (BRIEF), and the NewestMETHODS: Between December 2021 and February 2022, consecutive English-speaking patients over the age of 18 presenting as new patients to an urban, hospital-based outpatient spine clinic were approached for participation. A sociodemographic survey, the BRIEF, and the NVS Health Literacy Assessment Tool were administered verbally. Simple and multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess the accuracy of each BRIEF question individually, and collectively, at predicting limited health literacy as defined by the NVS. Further regression analysis included sociodeemployment status, marital status, annual household income, insurance status, and self-reported health.RESULTS: A total of 262 patients [mean age (years), 57 +/- 17] were included in this study. One hundred thirty-four (51%) were male, 223 (85%) were White, and 151 (58%) were married. Patient BRIEF scores were as follows: 23 (9%) limited, 43 (16%) marginal, and 196 (75%) adequate. NVS scores identified 87 (33%) patients with possible limited health literacy. BRIEF items collectively demonstrated fair accuracy in the prediction of limited health literacy (area under the receiver oper-ating characteristic curve, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70-0.82). Individually, the fourth BRIEF item (""How confident are you in filling out medical forms by yourself?"") was the best predictor of limited health literacy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60-0.73). The pre-dictive accuracy of the BRIEF items, both individually and collectively, increased with the inclu-sion of sociodemographic variables within the logistic regression. Specific characteristics independently associated with limited health literacy were self-identified Black race, retired or dis-abled employment status, single or divorced marital status, high school education or below, and self-reported ""poor"" health. CONCLUSIONS: Limited health literacy has implications for patient outcomes and health care costs. Our results show that the BRIEF questionnaire is a low-cost screening tool that demonstrates fair predictability in determining limited health literacy within a population of spine patients. Self -reported health literacy assessments may be more feasible in daily practice and easier to implement into clinical workflow. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Increasing cannabis use among pregnant people and equivocal evidence linking prenatal cannabis exposure to adverse outcomes in offspring highlights the need to understand its potential impact on pregnancy and child outcomes. Assessing cannabis use during pregnancy remains a major challenge with potential influences of stigma on self-report as well as detection limitations of easily collected biological matrices. Objective: This descriptive study examined the concordance between self-reported (SR) cannabis use and urine drug screen (UDS) detection of cannabis exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy and characterized concordant and discordant groups for sociodemographic factors, modes of use, secondhand exposure to cannabis and tobacco, and alcohol use and cotinine positivity. Study design: The Cannabis Use During Development and Early Life (CUDDEL) Study is an ongoing longitudinal study that recruits pregnant individuals presenting for obstetric care, who report lifetime cannabis use as well as using (n = 289) or not using cannabis (n = 169) during pregnancy. During the first trimester pregnancy visit, SR of cannabis use and a UDS for cannabis, other illicit drugs and nicotine are acquired from eligible participants, of whom 333 as of 05/01/2023 had both. Results: Using available CUDDEL Study data on both SR and UDS (n = 333; age 26.6 +/- 4.7; 88.6% Black; 45.4% below federal poverty threshold; 56.5% with paid employment; 89% with high school education; 22% first pregnancy; 12.3 +/- 3.6 weeks gestation), we classified pregnant individuals with SR and UDS data into 4 groups based on concordance (k = 0.49 [95% C.I. 0.40-0.58]) between SR cannabis use and UDS cannabis detection during the first trimester: 1) SR+/UDS+ (n = 107); 2) SR-/UDS- (n = 142); 3) SR+/UDS- (n = 44); 4) SR-/UDS+ (n = 40). Those who were SR+/UDS- reported less frequent cannabis use and fewer hours under the influence of cannabis during their pregnancy. Those who were SR-/UDS+ were more likely to have joined the study at a lower gestational age with 62.5% reporting cannabis use during their pregnancy prior to being aware that they were pregnant. Of the 40 SR-/UDS+ women, 14 (i.e., 35%) reported past month secondhand exposure, or blunt usage. In the subset of individuals with SR and UDS available at trimester 2 (N = 160) and 3 (N = 140), concordant groups were mostly stable and > 50% of those in the discordant groups became concordant by the second trimester. Classifying individuals as exposed or not exposed who were SR+ and/or UDS+ resulted in minor changes in group status based on self-report at screening. Conclusion: Overall, there was moderate concordance between SR and UDS for cannabis use/exposure during pregnancy. Instances of SR+/UDS- discordancy may partially be attributable to lower levels of use that are not detected on UDS. SR-/UDS+ discordancy may arise from recent use prior to knowledge of pregnancy, extreme secondhand exposure, deception, and challenges with completing questionnaires. Acquiring both self-report and biological detection of cannabis use/exposure allows for the examination of convergent evidence. Classifying those who are SR+ and/or UDS+ as individuals who used cannabis during their first trimester after being aware of their pregnancy resulted in only a minor change in exposure status; thus, relying on self-report screening, at least in this population and within this sociocultural context likely provides an adequate approximation of cannabis use during pregnancy.","Bogdan, Ryan Leverett, Shelby D.

"This study surveyed patients with chronic heart failure to better understand their experiences and perceptions of living with heart failure, including their familiarity and concerns with important guideline-directed medical therapies. Key PointsQuestionWhat are patient perceptions and priorities while living with heart failure (HF) and when choosing therapies for HF? FindingsIn this survey study of 429 patients with HF, respondents reported functioning independently, reducing morbidity/mortality, and minimizing HF symptoms as their most important priorities. Most survey responders reported familiarity with beta -blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics; less than 25% reported familiarity with angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. MeaningMany patients are not familiar with guideline-directed medical therapies for HF and/or question the safety and effectiveness of therapy, and these findings may significantly contribute to underutilization of guideline-directed medical therapies observed in prior studies. ImportanceThere are major gaps in use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for patients with heart failure (HF). Patient-reported data outlining patient goals and preferences associated with GDMT are not available. ObjectiveTo survey patients with chronic HF to better understand their experiences and perceptions of living with HF, including their familiarity and concerns with important GDMT therapies. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsStudy participants were recruited from the GfK KnowledgePanel, a probability-sampled online panel representative of the US adult population. English-speaking adults who met the following criteria were eligible if they were (1) previously told by a physician that they had HF; (2) currently taking medications for HF; and (3) had no history of left ventricular assist device or cardiac transplant. Data were collected between October and November 2018. Analysis began in December 2018. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe survey included 4 primary domains: (1) relative importance of disease-related goals, (2) challenges associated with living with HF, (3) decision-making process associated with HF medication use, and (4) awareness and concerns about available HF medications. ResultsOf 30707 KnowledgePanel members who received the initial survey, 15091 (49.1%) completed the screening questions, 440 were eligible and began the survey, and 429 completed the survey. The median (interquartile range) age was 68 (60-75) years and most were white (320 [74.6%]), male (304 [70.9%]), and had at least a high school education (409 [95.3%]). Most survey responders reported familiarity with beta -blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. Overall, 107 (24.9%) reported familiarity with angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Overall, 136 patients (42.5%) reported have safety concerns regarding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 133 (38.5%) regarding beta -blockers, 35 (37.9%) regarding mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, 38 (36.5%) regarding angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, and 123 (37.2%) regarding diuretics. Between 27.7% (n = 26) and 38.5% (n = 136) reported concerns regarding the effectiveness of beta -blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or diuretics, while 41% (n = 132) were concerned with the effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this survey study, many patients were not familiar with GDMT for HF, with familiarity lowest for angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Among patients not familiar with these therapies, significant proportions questioned their effectiveness and/or safety. Enhanced patient education and shared decision-making support may be effective strategies to improve the uptake of GDMT for HF in US clinical practice.","Samsky, Marc D. Lin, Li Greene, Stephen J.

"This cross-sectional study compares the prevalence of breast and colorectal cancer screening adherence and identifies factors associated with screening adherence among women residing in rural vs urban areas. Question Could the amenability index be extended to account for differences in breast and colorectal cancer screening adherence among women residing in urban vs rural communities in the United States? Findings In a cross-sectional study of 2897 women from 11 US states, lower colorectal cancer screening adherence was found among rural-dwelling women compared with urban-dwelling women, but the prevalence of screening adherence for breast cancer was similar among women residing in urban and rural communities. Meaning Rural colorectal cancer screening disparities could be explained by slower diffusion of colorectal cancer screening and present significant preventable public health challenges, which could be attenuated through effective interventions to increase diffusion of screening modalities. Importance Screening for breast and colorectal cancer has resulted in reductions in mortality; however, questions remain regarding how these interventions are being diffused to all segments of the population. If an intervention is less amenable to diffusion, it could be associated with disparities in mortality rates, especially in rural vs urban areas. Objectives To compare the prevalence of breast and colorectal cancer screening adherence and to identify factors associated with screening adherence among women residing in rural vs urban areas in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based cross-sectional study of women aged 50 to 75 years in 11 states was conducted from 2017 to 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Adherence to cancer screening based on the US Preventative Services Task Force guidelines. For breast cancer screening, women who had mammograms in the past 2 years were considered adherent. For colorectal cancer screening, women who had (1) a stool test in the past year, (2) a colonoscopy in the past 10 years, or (3) a sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years were considered adherent. Rural status was coded using Rural Urban Continuum Codes, and other variables were assessed to identify factors associated with screening. Results The overall sample of 2897 women included 1090 (38.4%) rural residents; 2393 (83.5%) non-Hispanic White women; 263 (9.2%) non-Hispanic Black women; 68 (2.4%) Hispanic women; 1629 women (56.2%) aged 50 to 64 years; and 712 women (24.8%) with a high school education or less. Women residing in urban areas were significantly more likely to be adherent to colorectal cancer screening compared with women residing in rural areas (1429 [82%] vs 848 [78%]; P = .01), whereas the groups were equally likely to be adherent to breast cancer screening (1347 [81%] vs 830 [81%]; P = .78). Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression analyses confirmed that rural residence was associated with lower odds of being adherent to colorectal cancer screening (odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99, P = .047). Non-Hispanic Black race was associated with adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.78-4.56; P < .001) but not colorectal cancer screening guidelines. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, women residing in rural areas were less likely to be adherent to colorectal cancer screening guidelines but were similarly adherent to breast cancer screening. This suggests that colorectal cancer screening, a more recent intervention, may not be as available in rural areas as breast cancer screening, ie, colorectal screening has lower amenability.","Shete, Sanjay Deng, Yangyang Shannon, Jackilen Faseru, Babalola Middleton, Deirdre Iachan, Ronaldo Bernardo, Brittany Balkrishnan, Rajesh Kim, Sunny Jung Huang, Bin Millar, Morgan M.

"This cross-sectional survey study of community-dwelling US adults aged 50 to 64 years examines their perspectives on health insurance, health care, and employment near retirement. Question Do US adults have concerns about health insurance during retirement, and if so, are these concerns associated with avoidance of medical care? Findings In this nationally representative survey study of 1028 US adults aged 50 to 64 years, 44.6% had low confidence in being able to afford health insurance during retirement, and 67.7% were concerned about potential changes to health insurance associated with changes in federal policies. Individuals with low confidence in health insurance affordability were more likely than those with higher confidence to avoid medical care and medications. Meaning Policy solutions are needed to help patients better understand coverage options and navigate health care during the critical transition period before Medicare eligibility. Importance As US adults approach Medicare eligibility at age 65 years, they face important decisions about health care and employment. Recent legislative, regulatory, and legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act may add new uncertainties to this decision-making. Objective To understand adults' perspectives on health insurance, health care, and employment near retirement. Design, Setting, and Participants In October 2018, a cross-sectional online survey study of community-dwelling US adults aged 50 to 64 years was conducted with Ipsos KnowledgePanel, a nationally representative internet survey panel (completion rate, 62%). The initial data analysis was conducted from November 2018 to March 2019, and additional analyses were conducted in November 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures Confidence in affording health insurance, keeping a job or delaying retirement to have employer-sponsored health insurance, concerns about potential changes to health insurance associated with changes in federal policies, and avoidance of medical care or medication because of cost. Results Among 1028 respondents aged 50 to 64 years (mean [SD] age, 57.0 [4.2] years), 51.8% (95% CI, 48.6%-55.0%) were female, 40.4% (95% CI, 37.2%-43.7%) had a high school education or less, 65.2% (95% CI, 62.1%-68.3%) were employed, and 34.8% (95% CI, 31.7%-37.9%) were retired or not working. Approximately one-fourth of respondents (27.4%; 95% CI, 24.6%-30.4%) had little to no confidence in being able to afford health insurance over the next year, and nearly one-half (44.6%; 95% CI, 41.4%-47.8%) had little to no confidence in their ability to afford health insurance when they retire; 14.1% (95% CI, 12.0%-16.5%) reported keeping a job and 11.4% (95% CI, 9.6%-13.6%) reported delaying or considering delaying retirement to have employer-sponsored health insurance. Most respondents (67.7%; 95% CI, 64.6%-70.6%) were very or somewhat concerned about potential changes to their health insurance associated with changes in federal policies. In the past year, 13.2% (95% CI, 11.2%-15.5%) of respondents did not get medical care and 11.9% (95% CI, 9.9%-14.1%) avoided filling a prescription medication because of cost. After adjusting for demographic and health characteristics, individuals with low confidence in health insurance affordability during either the next year or retirement were significantly more likely than those with higher confidence to avoid medical care (adjusted odds ratio, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.86-4.49; P < .001) and to avoid filling a prescription medication (adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.71-4.80; P < .001) because of cost concerns. Conclusions and Relevance Many adults aged 50 to 64 years worry about their ability to afford health insurance during retirement and about potential future changes to their health insurance options associated with changes in federal policy. Policy solutions are needed to help patients better understand their coverage options and navigate health care in this critical transition period before Medicare eligibility.","Tipirneni, Renuka Solway, Erica Malani, Preeti Luster, Jamie Kullgren, Jeffrey T.

"1. Context and Research Questions Trends in teacher education research reflect changes in policies, systems, and practices as well as the challenges and strategies involved in addressing them. A thorough understanding of these trends is required to propose effective changes to policies and systems and improve teacher education practices (Darling-Hammond, 2016). However, a thorough review of the relevant literature is necessary to determine the factors influencing these trends. To identify issues and knowledge structures in teacher education and examine how these issues are studied, analyzed, and interpreted, researchers must understand how trends in teacher education research have shifted over time and how these trends have influenced teacher education practices. Therefore, we used bibliometric tools to explore the past, present, and future of teacher education research as well as the knowledge clusters and trends in international research on teacher education that are hidden in co-occurrences and burst terms. 2. Literature Review 2.1 Research Scope We examined teacher education during the preservice and induction periods. The terms preservice teacher, teacher student, prospective teacher, and teacher candidate are used to denote individuals that have not yet become regular (in-service) teachers and were the key terms searched for in this study. 2.2 Approaches to Teacher Education Research Teacher education research is greatly influenced by political and professional developments; thus, contemporary historical and political contexts, the positioning of teacher education, definitions of teacher education issues, and research methods influence the body of research (Cochran-Smith & Fries, 2005). Teacher education research considers both the teaching profession and policy implications (Darling-Hammond, 2016). Research on the teaching profession considers the knowledge and competencies of effective teaching strategies for school education, and various theoretical perspectives (e.g., teacher belief, teacher identity) have been used to explore the influencing factors of preservice teachers' learning experiences (Cochran-Smith, 2016; Popkewitz et al., 1979). 2.3 Types of Teacher Education Research Frameworks Teacher education research has been categorized into handbooks and literature reviews. Both have their own characteristics, advantages, and limitations. For example, teacher education research handbooks are limited by the editors' judgments and choices of the author or editor. Moreover, they primarily discuss current issues and are thus not wholly reflective of the overarching knowledge structure of teacher education research. By contrast, literature reviews often collect and analyze literature on the basis of a specific perspective or concept but lost others (Houston, 2008). The evolution of perspectives, methodologies, and approaches has increased the discourse and diversity within teacher education research (Cochran-Smith & Fries, 2005; Shulman, 1986). 3. Methods To investigated development of teacher education research, academic articles from 1980 to 2020 that double-blind peer reviews were retrieved from the Web of Science. After filtering for relevance, 1,779 articles were shortlisted. Next, the bibliometric tools, VOSviewer and CiteSpace, were used to understand the focus of teacher education research during different periods, to describe the changes and challenges of teacher education policies, systems, and practices over the past 40 years, and to identify future research trends. 4. Results and Discussion We identified five clusters of teacher education research: teaching practice and reflection, teacher education program design, teacher beliefs and qualitative research, teacher knowledge and self-efficacy, and teacher identity. By analyzing keywords and burst terms, we discovered 44 burst terms that evolved over time. In addition, the research hotspots have varied over the past 40 years, with each trend lasting only a short period. During 1980-2010, teacher education research was dominated by teacher education policy, including training and reform. After 2010, the focus of research alternated between teaching practices and noncognitive learning. Between 2015 and 2020, mathematics, content knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge were the focus of research, indicating the importance of teacher knowledge and mathematics. Finally, through the literature review and a big data analysis, we discovered the following trends in teacher education research: (1) At the macro level, the focus of teacher training policies has gradually shifted from teacher education to the implementation of educational equity and social justice. (2) On a more specific level, the how institutions cooperate with schools for teacher education and how they analyze the impacts of certain contexts on teacher education process have changed. (3) On the micro level, teacher education has been gradually extended to include changes in various aspects of preservice teachers' learning. 5. Suggestions Research on teacher education policy is based on multiple standpoints-and in some cases, opposition. Future policy research should employ empirical, scientific evidence to improve policy and debate the effectiveness of teacher education. Teacher education research is deeply influenced by political, social, and cultural factors and should be conducted by teams that test, collect, and analyze data on preservice teachers' learning environments to identify influential contextual factors. By so doing, a strong foundation can be established for the systematic design of teacher education programs and acquisition of supporting resources. The cognitive and noncognitive learning of preservice teachers is influenced by their personalities and preparation. How changes occur and how preservice teachers can be internally motivated should continue to be explored. Going forward, researchers should consider philosophical, historical, and sociological insights to assess global developments and identify new research goals by reflecting on the academic discourse with peers and across boundaries.","Huang, Jia-Li Chen, Mei-Ju Weng, Hsuan-Jui",,"Huang, JL Chen, MJ Weng, HJ",1,"[Huang, Jia-Li] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Teacher Educ, Fac Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

"Children attending primary school in 2020, typically between the ages of 6 and 12, will be between 36 and 42 years old in 2050, and those in high schools will be between six and twelve years older. This means that they will be in the prime of their lives, possibly at the apex of their careers, and preparing for the next phases of their lives, namely working towards retirement and old age. Education in general, and school education in particular, now, in the year 2020, has a duty to prepare children (learners, students) for life up to 2050 and beyond, so that they will be able to traverse those life-phases successfully. Citizenship Education (henceforth abbreviated CE), in addition to the foundation provided by all the other school subjects, has the special task of preparing young people to live successfully in society, in their own communities, within their own national borders and also in the wider world. The problem that confronts one in this regard is how to predict the future: What will the world be like in 2050? Future studies are known for their many pitfalls, among others historical determinism and over-simplified predictions. Many methods have in the past been employed to ""predict"" the future, and none of them has been proved to be infallible. What is the point then of trying to equip young people in 2020 for a successful life and existence in 2050 and beyond? A twofold answer can be given to this question. The first is normative or prescriptive: to outline a desired or preferred future, one that we assume to be the best for our children as the grown-ups and the society leaders of 2050. The second is descriptive: As fallible human beings who are in principle and in practice unable to see three decades and further ahead into the future, we can only surmise what the future will hold for us and our children. A descriptive approach combined with a systems-view about what could potentially be expected to unfold in 2050 and beyond was employed in this study. The approach was not normative and hence did not employ backcasting or ""imagineering"" techniques. After examining various methods for creating future scenario's such as prediction, scenario sketching and planning, a systems-view in terms of the 15 modal dimensions of reality was adopted. In describing the potential developments in terms of each of these 15 modal dimensions, care was taken not to be too specific because experience indicates that the future tends to take unexpected twists and turns. After having tentatively sketched a possible future in terms of the 15 modalities of reality, the question arises: What should we do now, at this point in time in 2020, to help citizens cope with life three decades into the future? Figuring out what worlds we are building, and our positions in those worlds in relation to others, is the essential task of education. CE as such has a two-fold task, namely to prepare the learners for their civic duties when the time comes for them to leave school, but also for the more distant future, when they are at the top of their performance in their careers as citizens of their countries and of the world, and even for life in the final stages of their existence on earth. CE should, therefore, be future-directed, but this orientation should be realistic. A heavy responsibility rests on the shoulders of CE educators (teachers) and all other school educators to guide learners in order to prepare them sufficiently to cope with the future as it unfolds. They also have to strengthen the learners' innate moral sense of what would count as right and wrong, good and bad behaviour in their particular societal configuration, also in the more distant future. Successful CE will have taken place if and when these two sets of values coincide in the consciousness of the learners. The challenge is to achieve this in the short term, albeit with a view to a more distant future. CE teachers or educators also have to guide their charges to peer ahead into the future, to 2050, and to help them come to terms with what may be expected when they are adults at the peak of their careers and of their lives as parents and members of society. New technologies might pose new challenges to teaching and learning. CE teachers, furthermore, will have to guide their charges so that they are ready and prepared to face the challenges awaiting them in this rather hazy future: the different roles that they might have to play, the pitfalls of an unpredicted and unpredictable future, the challenge to be creative and to be able to think and act on their feet, the challenge to remain true to oneself, to one's own value system (one's moral structure) and one's religion and religious commitment, and many more. CE teachers will have to equip their charges with an understanding of what it would mean and take to live successfully in 2050 and beyond; they have to understand that success needs not necessarily be expressed in terms of wealth or a neoliberal or neo-conservative understanding thereof. The teacher's own integrity, life-view and religious convictions are likely to play a role here as part of the hidden curriculum. Innovation will have to be a key concept in CE; innovation is essential for adjusting to rapid and accelerating change. Students have to be prepared to be comfortable with working and living alongside robots, machines and other technological innovations. Students have to be equipped to cope with constantly changing and fluid conditions. Already in our own time, students have become accustomed to the notion of boundaries weakening or disappearing altogether, especially those between workplaces, homes, entertainment venues and educational establishments. Finally, citizenship educators will in the near, as well in a more distant future, apply renewed concentration on educating the future generations to become and remain individuals able to maintain a healthy balance in life. It is suggested that CE teachers take note of the developments expected to unfold in the next three decades, as described and discussed in this article under the headings of the 15 modalities of reality. By attending to each one of these modalities in educating the youngsters in their care, they will arguably contribute to a healthy balance in the lives of those youngsters entrusted to their care. It is not humanly possible to predict or forecast the future. It is nevertheless incumbent upon the educators of 2020, parents and teachers, to prepare their charges to be ready and prepared for the future as it unfolds. The impact of all future explorations, the respective potentials for the future, can only be meaningfully assessed in our own time. The relevance of any discourse about the future lies in the present. In view of this, the argument proffered in this article comes down to the following: Although we cannot be specific about what exactly life in 2050 and beyond will be like, Citizenship Education as school subject can already now, in 2020, begin to equip, guide and direct children and young people by helping them master a set of skills that will arguably be suitable for all conditions, such as instilling a consciousness and a conscience regarding what would be to the advantage of humankind; what would lead to the well-being of self and of society, the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad; that success need not necessarily be measured in materialistic and neoliberal terms but rather in terms of leading a good, fruitful and meaningful life; that one's life-view and concomitant value system will remain the guiding light on the way to an unknown future, to be imaginative, innovative, creative, able to think on one's feet, and be resilient in the face of affliction.","van der Walt, J.

"The decolonisation of education debate has (re)surfaced in South Africa. It is acknowledged that decolonisation is a complex and multi-layered process (see Jansen 2017; Le Grange 2016; Le Grange 2018; Venter 2018; Mbembe 2015; CHE 2017). Clarification and understanding of the complex concepts such as Africanisation, Eurocentrism, Westernisation, colonialism, colonially, decolonialism and decoloniality also surfaced (see Jansen 2017; Le Grange 2016; Le Grange 2018; Maldonado-Torres 2007; Venter 2018; Mbembe 2015; CHE 2017). However, there is a silence in current discourses when it comes to teacher education (Saved, Motala & Hoffman 2017) and specifically Economics Teaching and Business Studies Teaching (EBST), since the focus of the decolonisation debate has been on higher education in general. Teacher education is afield that functions at the interface of higher education and schooling and therefore the complexity and context of the school system an)directly impact on teacher education programmes. Mbembe (2015:17) argues that most of the implications for decolonising higher education have to do with content and the extent of what is to be taught (curriculum reform). But, this does not mean that decolonising knowledge is simply about de-Westernisation or to reject Western epistemic contributions to the world (Mignolo 2011:82), or to reverse technological advancement, or simply turn back the clock and revert to old ways of doing (Le Grange 2016). Rather, it is about developing a ""perspective which can allow us to see ourselves clearly, but always in relationship with ourselves and to other selves in the universe, non-humans included"" (Mbembe 2015:24). The question is how the EBST curriculum, as part of an initial teacher education programme, can be decolonised. Not enough is known about the alignment of EBST k contextual and content knowledge in decolonising of teacher education. The aim of this article is to extend the conversation on decolonising of the curriculum by focusing on EBST disciplinary/content knowledge and the generation of contextually relevant knowledge. Young and Muller (2013:107-108) view disciplinary knowledge as ""powerful knowledge"" that is regarded as ""reliable knowledge"" and produced in ""specialist knowledge communities"" with ""rules"", ""concepts"" and ""boundaries"". Horden (2018) maintains that the powerfulness depicted by Young and Muller is also dependent on certain socio-epistemic and institutional conditions. Maistry and David (2018) are of the view that business education has shown an ideological bias, which is couched within a predominant neo-classical worldview that is mostly devoid of local (South) African realities. Moreover, firms in Africa have received little attention in mainstream business management literature (Barnard, Cuervo-Cazurra & Manning 2017). Barnard et at (2017:3) argue that there are different dimensions of the business world at play in Africa that we are only beginning to understand For example, traditional concepts such as ubuntu, an African concept which means ""I only exist through my interaction with you"", play an important institutional role in many African firms. Contemporary business in Africa takes place in a context where people are mindful of the relative recent history of colonialism (Barnard et al. 2017). The perpetuation of imperial or neo-colonial tendencies cannot be looked at in isolation from socio-economic realities. We argue that knowledge needs to be looked at in the context and history of colonialism and apartheid, and the overt and covert features of the (mis)management of power. The pre- and post-colonial eras have footprints in present day wealth inequality and a disposition that is rooted in institutions and organisations. Institutions and organisations are firmly entrenched in modern-day business and the economy, which enfold EBST content knowledge. Therefore the role of institutions is discussed, and examples put forward to illustrate its importance in EBST. We argue that insights into three aspects, namely, why history matters, asking guiding questions and modelling contextualized teaching, could provide guidelines for aligning contextual and content knowledge in teacher education. The first aspect relates to path dependency which broadly defines the way the patterns of the past tend to shape the future (North 1990). The history of colonial Africa has become a popular topic in the development and economics literature (Viegi 2016) and recently also in the literature on decolonisation of higher and school education in South Africa. At the higher education level broadly, there is the call for the recognition of African voices in the advancement and reproduction of knowledge (Mbembe 2015). At school level a specific call is made for the teaching of history from an Afrocentric view as opposed to a Eurocentric worldview (Motsega 2018). History is important since it gives insight into understanding current inequality and understanding of a particular mindset ofpre- and post-colonial eras we are still troubled by today. The importance of history and the coloniality of power are also deeply interwoven in institutions and organisations. The second aspect of contextualized teaching is to ask guiding questions such as ""why do countries differ so much in development?"" (Acemoglu & Robinson 2012). EBST teacher educators are often themselves not critical about the formal curriculum so as to mediate learning that raises questions about the conduct and decision-making of corporates. As is the case with most subjects, the question is which content is considered to be the most impacy'ul, how should it be taught and in which context. Asking pertinent questions about the impact of economic crises or key contemporary issues in (South) Africa, and challenging existing worldviews are important. The third aspect of contextualised teaching is to explicitly model contextualised thinking, which can be done through a path of learning which could facilitate ""intervulturaliry: a process ofun-learn, re-learn and then move toward learning to undertaking"" (De Carvalho & Florez-Florez 2014:134). Interculturality is an active process of transformation, which identifies the integrated relationships between persons or social groups of diverse worldviews and cultures. Selecting relevant EBST resource material is important, such as use of African case studies and the encouragement of Afrocentric innovations (Barnard et al. 2017). For years, the most accessible and dominant resources for EBST have been from a Western and/or Eurocentric worldview from which narratives revolve around a masculine, white, and liberal view of reality (Maistry & David 2018). Over the years, educators became dependent on these knowledge systems, epistemological traditions and curriculum materials. Applying knowledge that is also relevant to (South) African contexts can allow students to better make sense of the discipline within which they study. The implications for the EBST-curriculum is therefore two -fold: the inclusion of African perspectives and secondly, the integration of economic and business history in the curriculum.","America, Carina Le Grange, Lesley",,"America, C Le Grange, L",106,"[America, Carina] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Kurrikulumstudie, Ekon & Bestuurswetenskappe, Fak Opvoedkunde, Stellenbosch, South Africa.

"Contemporary teaching methods and approaches are increasingly being directed towards learners (instead of teachers), learner competences (instead of abilities), learner autonomy and responsibility for learning (instead of viewing them as ""empty recepticles"", i.e. passive participants in the learning process). Thus, learners and learner outcomes have been growingly placed at the forefront of modern-day teaching, which is visible both in scholarly papers within the educational studies, as well as tendencies in teaching practices and practical suggestions proposed by national education systems. The subject matter of our study is a teaching approach that views the learner as an active and a proactive participant, and their constructive interaction with the other learners as the crucial milestone for maximum performance, along with the development of intra- and interpersonal skills of each learner. Although the concept of cooperation may find its roots in a wide range of learning theories, it primarily derives from and draws on the social interdependance theory, as advocated by numerous researchers in the field. According to this theory, social interdependence is divided into positive interdependence (cooperation), negative (competition) and non-existent (individualistic efforts); hence, the accomplishment of each learner's goals is affected by the actions of other participants in the learning process. In sum, the critical components of cooperative learning include: (1) positive interdependence, (2) individual accountability, (3) group processing, (4) social skills, and (5) structuring and structures. In light of the subject matter of the current study, which involves language teachers (L1, L2, L3), and positive interdependence in particular, group members need to understand that what helps one member helps all other group members at the same time, and the other way round (e.g. in group essay writing, group presentations etc). Concerning group processing and group formation in specific, teachers need to bear in mind several factors, the most important ones being determining group size and assigning students to particular groups. According to the central premises of cooperative learning, groups are mostly small and include two (a pair) or three-four students (a small group). Teacher's decision will naturally depend on the type of task, learners' age, timing, learner learning styles and/or interests/affinities, the number of students in class, and so on. Therefore, the important issues to be addressed would be who is the one who assigns the students to groups (teacher, learners), in what way (randomly or deliberately), learners' roles within groups (e.g. equal roles, i.e. all students have the same/similar task, or different, pre-determined roles: there is a judge, an interviewer and interviewee etc). With regard to individual accountability, each group member is expected to contribute to their group both as an individual and a member of the group (e.g. teacher gives each student a mark based on their individual and group share in groupwork or teamwork project). Social skills, such as communicative skills and conflict-resolution skills, determine the way in which students cooperate with other group members, which makes it a requirement to train students for such a teaching format since there are different types of learners (high- and low-achievers, leaders and followers, extraverted and introverted students, and so on). Therefore, teacher's role is to monitor each group's dynamics, or more specifically, whether there is equal participation of its members, respect for diversity and/or different opinions, but also to foster the development of student teamwork skills. Structuring refers to the ways in which a teacher organises learner interaction, and structures represent various teaching techniques, activity types employed in the classroom (e.g. Three-Step Interview, Round Robin, Roundtable etc). Finally, unlike other teaching methods and approaches used in language classrooms, cooperative learning, as part of a broader approach (i.e. collaborative learning), supports the structural, functional and interactional view of language. What is more, it also enables the development of key competences, which are frequently addressed as vital by national and international educational bodies and documents, such as competences for lifelong learning, communication and social competences, problem-solving and decision-making competencies, citizenship competences, but also cherishes the development of other key competences. As regards research into the benefits and/or drawbacks of cooperative learning in class, a plethora of research indicates that cooperative learning has multifaceted benefits. In contrast to so-called traditional teaching, which is fundamentally directed at teachers, so classes are teacher-centred, fostering competition in the first place, cooperative learning cherishes the cooperation and achievement of all students (or more realistically, the majority of them). It also facilitates the development of interpersonal relationships and is thus crucial for a positive rapport in the classroom, it provides students with experiences necessary for a healthy social, psychological and cognitive development, as supported by a large body of research. Numerous studies report that it leads to the development of interdisciplinary competencies, such as decision-making, forming hypotheses, categorisation, social skills (such as teamwork skills) via socio-affective learning, subject-related but also a wide array of other skills (social, socio-political, life skills), as well as critical thinking. It exerts positive effects on learner achievement, better relationships among students (class rapport), class evaluation, respect for one another, problem-solving, self-confidence in learner's abilities, it prepares students for the role of future citizens in the world of adults, it focuses on learners and learning, it offers students mechanisms for holistic learning, and above all, it teaches them how to learn. Research suggests, though, that the main disadvantage of cooperative learning is that it might suit high-achievers least since there are studies that show that low-achievers benefit both in homogenous and heterogeneous groups, whereas high-achievers experience advantages only in homogeneous, at least relative to the knowledge they might gain. However, although high-achievers feel a lack of mental challenges, the support they provide to average students or low-achievers may facilitate the acquisition of the key competences (e.g. cooperative), on the one hand, and they also cognitively rehearse the given contents by helping the struggling students, on the other (cf. the concept of tutoring). Briefly put, teachers should aim to provide the optimum balance in choosing group members and assigning student roles to the best benefit of all students in the classroom. To conclude, although cooperative learning may be implemented at any educational level and with any school subject, it is highly suitable for the subject matter of our study, namely language and literature classes. Therefore, the main goal of this explorative research is to determine how language teachers perceive cooperative learning in terms of its main characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, its implementation potentials etc. The main assumption is that the teachers from the sample will equate cooperative learning with mere group work and regard it as a productive but yet not so desirable teaching approach (e.g. due to the organisation of activities, leading to creative noise). The subsidiary goal is to determine to what extent and when the participants most frequently employ the said teaching approach. The main hypothesis is that they employ it most in practice and revision lessons, as a result of preconceptions that introductory lessons must be delivered via the whole-class interaction type, with the teacher as the most reliable source of knowledge (the knower). In this study, we employed the snowball sampling method, thereby initially recruiting ninety primary and secondary school language teachers (L1, L2, L3) working in different cities in Serbia. However, the final sample included eighty-two fully completed questionnaires. The sample were unevenly distributed according to the sex criterion (f=95.1%, m=4.9%), aged twenty-six to fifty-seven (M=42.32, StD=6.50), with years of work experience ranging from two to thirty-two (M=15.78, StD=7.99). Distribution according to the level of school education was quite balanced, including 43.9% of primary and 56.1% of secondary school language teachers, with quite equal distribution according to the secondary school broad types (52.2% of grammar school teachers and 47.8% of vocational school teachers). Concerning the language they taught, the highest percentage of the sample comprised Serbian (48.8%), English (29.3%), German (9.8%) and French language teachers (7.3%). Due to the COVID 2020 pandemic, the research was conducted online, and data were gathered via Google forms app. The employed online questionnaire included general sociodemographic data (age, sex, years of work experience, school type etc), as well as a part dealing with how the teachers perceive cooperative learning. This part included self-reports in the form of a six-point Likert-type scale (e.g. How often do you use cooperative learning in your classes? 1 never, 2 rarely, 3 sometimes, 4 often, 5 very often, 6 always), and open-cloze questions, given in the form of narratives (e.g. How would you define cooperative learning, regardless of the fact whether you are familiar with this teaching approach or not). According to the nature of an item, the results were analysed quantitatively (e.g. self-reports were analysed in the statistical programme IBM SPSS Statistics 21 by calculating descriptive statistics: means, standard deviation, percentage) and qualitatively (e.g. open cloze questions via a multi-layered content analysis: first, the answers were coded to form the categories, then the concrete formulations were extracted, and finally numerical values were assigned within the extracted categories to obtain the most frequently reported answers/reasons). The results show that the greatest number of the participants use cooperative learning (78.3%), whereby 46.3% use it sometimes, and 22% often, which to a certain extent tallies with the responses dealing with the fact whether they are acquainted with this teaching approach (75.6% stated that they were, 24.4% that they were not). The most frequently reported reason for never using this teaching approach was that they were not familiar with it, and a small number stated that classes number too many students or that they have ""no one to work with"". Concerning the definition of this approach, regardless of the fact whether they are familiar with the postulates of cooperative learning or not, the teachers most commonly define it as ""teamwork"" or ""mutual learning"" (92.7%). Out of the stated percent, more than half of the participants (51.2%) included the key elements of cooperative learning in their descriptions: a sense of community in terms of teamwork (cf. social skills, i.e. the development of teamwork/cooperative skills), as well as mutual efforts in solving the given problems (cf. positive interdependence of group members), with a small number of the participants pointing to the individual accountability of each team member in specific. Regarding its advantages and disadvantages, the participants recognised the importance of cooperative learning, and a substantial number of them had developed awareness of its advantages. As its main benefits, the participants primarily stated: (1) learner engagement in lessons and the learning process, motivation and peer learning (51.2%), (2) social skills development (team, organisational, communicative) (36.6%), and (3) facilitation of a range of learner abilities (creativity, functional and long-lasting knowledge) (26.8%). As its drawbacks, they reported (1) unequal learner engagement (e.g. high-achievers take on themselves the realisation of the group work) (28.1%), (2) noise, poor organisation and realisation of a cooperative activity (20%), and (3) inability to focus on an individual learner due to group-centeredness (9.4%). Furthermore, 15.6% reported that cooperative learning had no drawbacks, while 18.8% stated they did not know anything about its disadvantages. Regarding the frequency of use in specific lesson types, cooperative learning was reported to be most frequently employed in introductory literature classes (29.6%) by Serbian language teachers, and revision grammar classes (25.9%) predominantly by English teachers. With respect to group formation, the highest number of the participants put forward (1) deliberate formation of heterogeneous groups (inclusion of learners with varying degrees of knowledge and/or abilities) (48.8%), (2) random group formation (e.g. by assigning students numbers, as they are sitting etc) (36.6%), (3) deliberate formation of homogeneous groups (according to learners' affinities, abilities and/or interpersonal relationships) (16.7%), and (4) by learners' choice (11.9%). Finally, regarding a potential workshop on implementing cooperative learning in class, the majority of the participants (85.4%) stated that they would find it useful, as compared to 12.2% defining it as ""not useful"" and 2.4% saying ""I don't know"". Upon elaboration, they reported its purposefulness in terms of a prospective workshop practical dimension, its applicability (29.3%), or more specifically: (1) receiving practical advice and solutions (e.g. efficient ways of dividing students into groups, valuing each group member's share of work and clear assessment criteria, along with concrete techniques/structures). Besides, they stated their aspiration to professional development, specifically: (2a) getting further acquainted with this approach (24.4%), and (2b) general improvement of their teaching and professional development (29.3%). Lastly, the main limitations of the conducted research were the sample size and its nature, uneven distribution by the sex criterion, and the mere nature of qualitative analysis, which does not assume standardised instruments and analytical procedures. In conclusion, despite the insightful comments given by a large number of the participants, some teachers still appear to cling to the belief that traditional classes and the teacher as the only relevant source of knowledge are crucial for complex teaching units (e.g. the introduction of a grammar unit that learners find difficult and complex). Finally, it is deemed necessary that teachers in Serbian state schools should be given support and trained in such a teaching approach. Consequently, the fact that a considerable number of the participants expressed their wish to attend a cooperative learning workshop is promising. Finally, in future studies, we aim to investigate not only the general perception of language teachers, but also their knowledge on concrete cooperative learning postulates to gain more valuable insights into the extent to which teachers are familiar with this teaching approach, but also to determine their beliefs and attitudes towards its actual use in the classroom. Such investigations might provide a step forward in Educational Studies, as well as Applied Linguistics (i.e. Second Language Acquisition) and Developmental Linguistics (L1 acquisition).","Grubor, Jelena V.",,"Grubor, JV",125,"[Grubor, Jelena V.] Drzavni Univ Novom Pazaru, Dept Filoloske Nauke, Novi Pazar, Serbia.",,,,,,2025-01-19,cooperative learning; L1 classes; L2/L3 classes; primary and secondary school teachers,10.31902/fll.45.2023.7,Article,,,bram.english@yahoo.co.uk,146,,,,NA1W2,ACHIEVEMENT,45,FOLIA LINGUIST LITT,Folia Linguist.
